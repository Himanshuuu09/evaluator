    "You are an expert educator, renowned for your ability to evaluate answers across various subjects with precision, fairness, and depth. Your task is to assess the user's answer based on the provided question, reference answer (if available), and the specific requirements of the subject.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Information for Evaluation:\n",
    "- **Reference Answer**: \"{state['gen_context']}\" (if provided; otherwise, base your evaluation on the question and subject knowledge)\n",
    "- **User's Answer**: \"{state['user_answer']}\"\n",
    "- **Question**: \"{state['user_question']}\"\n",
    "- **Question Type**: \"{state['question_type']}\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation Guidelines:\n",
    "1. **Understand the Question**:\n",
    "   - Analyze the question carefully to determine its key requirements, such as concepts, steps, grammar, or factual accuracy.\n",
    "2. **Evaluate the User's Answer Based on Subject**:\n",
    "   - **English**: Check for correct grammar, sentence structure, vocabulary usage, and whether the answer aligns with the question's intent.\n",
    "   - **Mathematics**: Evaluate the answer step-by-step, ensuring calculations, formulas, and logic are accurate, and verify the final answer.\n",
    "   - **General Knowledge**: Verify the correctness and relevance of the answer against factual information.\n",
    "   - **Other Subjects**: Ensure the answer demonstrates understanding of the subject, relevance to the question, and correctness of concepts or facts.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Apply the Scoring Criteria**:\n",
    "   - **Factual Accuracy**: Score between 1-10 based on correctness and precision of the answer.\n",
    "   - **Completeness**: Score between 1-10 based on how well the answer addresses all parts of the question.\n",
    "   - **Errors**: Deduct points (up to 10) for mistakes, irrelevant information, or gaps in logic, grammar, or steps.\n",
    "   - **Bonus for Excellence**: (Optional) Add bonus points for exceptional depth, creativity, or clarity, while staying within the total score limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Calculate Total Score and Percentage**:\n",
    "   - The maximum total score is **40**.\n",
    "   - Convert the total score into a percentage: `(total_score / 40) * 100`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Special Case**:\n",
    "   - If the answer does not address the question or is entirely irrelevant, assign a **total score** of 0 and a **percentage** of 0%.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scoring Output:\n",
    "Provide your evaluation in the following structured JSON format:\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{{\n",

However, Sherwood Senior Correspondent Rani Molla suggests this public show of support was more calculated than genuine. \"It\\'s like they all prompted ChatGPT for the same response to publicly and then privately talk to Trump,\" Molla told Catalysts. She notes this was quite different from the tech leaders\\' reactions to Trump\\'s 2016 win as CEOs now understand from his first presidency that he is capable of \"hold[ing] a grudge\" or being \"very vindictive.\" Molla singles out Tesla (TSLA) and Elon Musk\\'s related companies, saying they \"stand to gain\" from Trump\\'s return to the White House due to Musk\\'s deep involvement in the former president\\'s reelection efforts. However, for the broader tech sector, she cautions that the landscape remains \"so uncertain\" given Trump\\'s potential policies around China tariffs and AI regulation.

In theory, the stock market efficiently allocates the nation\\'s capital to generate solid investment returns. Theory typically turns into reality in November, which since 1980 has been the best month for equity performance, with an average 2.1% gain, ahead of April (+1.60%), July (+1.4%) December (+1.3%), and October (+1.3%). November\\'s batting average is high as well: stocks advance during the month 72% of the time. The best Novembers have been 1980 (+10.2%), 2001 (+7.5%), 1996 (+7.3%), 1985 (+6.5%), 1998 (+5.9%), and 2002 (+5.1%). But there have been some clunkers: 2000 (-8%), 2008 (-7.5%) and 1987 (-5.9%).  Last year, the S&P 500 rose an impressive 8.9% for the month.  What about during presidential-election years?  Good question. The track record is even more impressive here. For the 11 election-year Novembers since 1980, stocks have, on average, climbed 2.6%. November usually starts off at a fast pace, as nonfarm payrolls are reported and many companies are still reporting 3Q earnings. This year, the Fed meets this week and will likely lower rates again. The presidential election will undoubtedly be close, and may take a few days to produce an eventual winner -- but that doesn\\'t have dent November\\'s long-time track record. \\nReturn to growth as services shine \\nApple manufactures smartphones, tablets, PCs, software, and peripherals for a worldwide customer base. Its products include Mac desktop and mobile PCs, iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and various consumer products, including AirPods, Beats headphones, and Apple TV. Apple services include App Store, iTunes, iCloud, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple Music, Apple Pay, and more. \\nU.S. stocks fell on Thursday on disappointing results from Tech companies. \\nU.S. stocks fell on Thursday on disappointing results from Tech companies.

Apple has progressively worked to add new applications, like streaming video, subscription bundles, and augmented reality. The firm designs its own software and semiconductors while working with subcontractors like Foxconn and TSMC to build its products and chips.

Jobs and Wozniak wanted to make computers small enough for people to have them in their homes or offices. Simply put, they wanted a computer that was user-friendly.1\\nJobs and Wozniak started out building the Apple I in Jobs\\' garage and sold them without a monitor, keyboard, or casing (which they decided to add on in 1977). The Apple II revolutionized the computer industry with the introduction of the first-ever color graphics. Sales jumped from $7.8 million in 1978 to $117 million in 1980, the year Apple went public.2\\nWozniak left Apple in 1983 due to a diminishing interest in the day-to-day running of Apple Computer. Jobs then hired PepsiCo\\'s John Sculley to be president. However, this move backfired and after much controversy with Sculley, Jobs left in 1985 and went on to new and bigger things. He founded his own company NeXT Software and he also bought Pixar from George Lucas, which would later become a huge success in computer animation of such movies as Toy Story, A Bug\\'s Life, Monsters, Inc., and Finding Nemo.3\\nThrough the rest of the 1980s, Apple was still doing well and in 1990 it posted its highest profits yet. This was, however, mostly due to the plans that Jobs had already set in motion before he left, most notably his deal with a tiny company by the name of Adobe, creator of the Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF). Together the two companies created the phenomenon known as desktop publishing.4\\nBack in 1985 Sculley turned down an appeal from Microsoft founder Bill Gates to license its software. This decision would later come back to haunt him because Microsoft, whose Windows operating system (OS) featured a graphical interface similar to Apple\\'s, became their toughest competition in the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s.\\nOver the course of a few years, Apple\\'s market share suffered slowly after its peak in 1990 and by 1996, experts believed the company to be doomed. It was not until 1997, when Apple was desperately in need of an operating system, that it bought out NeXT Software (Jobs\\' company) and the board of directors decided to ask for some help from an old friend: Steve Jobs. Jobs became an interim CEO, or iCEO as he called himself (Jobs was not officially the CEO until 2000). Jobs decided to make some changes around Apple. He forged an alliance with Microsoft to create a Mac version of its popular office software. Not long after this decision was the turning point for the company. Jobs revamped the computers and introduced the iBook (a personal laptop) followed by iPod, an mp3 player, which became market leader.\\nThe iPhone, a touch screen cellular phone, introduced in 2007 was one of the world\\' most successful products and the company has released several new versions since. Not long after\\xa0the announcement of iPhone and Apple TV, the company dropped \"Computer\" from its name to become \"Apple\\xa0Inc.,\" indicating that it is about more than just computers.

With Steve Wozniak, Jobs founded Apple Inc. in 1976 and transformed the company into a world leader in telecommunications. Widely considered a visionary and a genius, he oversaw the launch of such revolutionary products as the iPod and the iPhone.', 'score': 0.9930153, 'raw_content': 'Steve Jobs\\nWhy is Steve Jobs significant?\\nWhat was Steve Jobs’s early life like?\\nHow did Steve Jobs die?\\nSteve Jobs (born February 24, 1955, San Francisco, California, U.S.—died October 5, 2011, Palo Alto, California) was the cofounder of Apple Computer, Inc. (now Apple Inc.), and a charismatic pioneer of the personal computer era.\\nFounding of Apple\\nJobs was raised by adoptive parents in Cupertino, California, located in what is now known as Silicon Valley. Though he was interested in engineering, his passions of youth varied. He dropped out of Reed College, in Portland, Oregon, took a job at Atari Corporation as a video game designer in early 1974, and saved enough money for a pilgrimage to India to experience Buddhism.\\nBack in Silicon Valley in the autumn of 1974, Jobs reconnected with Stephen Wozniak, a former high school friend who was working for the Hewlett-Packard Company. When Wozniak told Jobs of his progress in designing his own computer logic board, Jobs suggested that they go into business together, which they did after Hewlett-Packard formally turned down Wozniak’s design in 1976. The Apple I, as they called the logic board, was built in the Jobses’ family garage with money they obtained by selling Jobs’s Volkswagen minibus and Wozniak’s programmable calculator.\\nJobs was one of the first entrepreneurs to understand that the personal computer would appeal to a broad audience, at least if it did not appear to belong in a junior high school science fair. With Jobs’s encouragement, Wozniak designed an improved model, the Apple II, complete with a keyboard, and they arranged to have a sleek, molded plastic case manufactured to enclose the unit.\\nThough Jobs had long, unkempt hair and eschewed business garb, he managed to obtain financing, distribution, and publicity for the company, Apple Computer, incorporated in 1977—the same year that the Apple II was completed. The machine was an immediate success, becoming synonymous with the boom in personal computers. In 1981 the company had a record-setting public stock offering, and in 1983 it made the quickest entrance (to that time) into the Fortune 500 list of America’s top companies. In 1983 the company recruited PepsiCo, Inc., president John Sculley to be its chief executive officer (CEO) and, implicitly, Jobs’s mentor in the fine points of running a large corporation. Jobs had convinced Sculley to accept the position by challenging him: “Do you want to sell sugar water for the rest of your life?” The line was shrewdly effective, but it also revealed Jobs’s own near-messianic belief in the computer revolution.\\nInsanely great\\nDuring that same period, Jobs was heading the most important project in the company’s history. In 1979 he led a small group of Apple engineers to a technology demonstration at the Xerox Corporation’s Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) to see how the graphical user interface could make computers easier to use and more efficient. Soon afterward, Jobs left the engineering team that was designing Lisa, a business computer, to head a smaller group building a lower-cost computer. Both computers were redesigned to exploit and refine the PARC ideas, but Jobs was explicit in favouring the Macintosh, or Mac, as the new computer became known. Jobs coddled his engineers and referred to them as artists, but his style was uncompromising; at one point he demanded a redesign of an internal circuit board simply because he considered it unattractive. He would later be renowned for his insistence that the Macintosh be not merely great but “insanely great.” In January 1984 Jobs himself introduced the Macintosh in a brilliantly choreographed demonstration that was the centrepiece of an extraordinary publicity campaign. It would later be pointed to as the archetype of “event marketing.”\\nHowever, the first Macs were underpowered and expensive, and they had few software applications—all of which resulted in disappointing sales. Apple steadily improved the machine, so that it eventually became the company’s lifeblood as well as the model for all subsequent computer interfaces. But Jobs’s apparent failure to correct the problem quickly led to tensions in the company, and in 1985 Sculley convinced Apple’s board of directors to remove the company’s famous cofounder.\\nNeXT and Pixar\\nJobs quickly started another firm, NeXT Inc., designing powerful workstation computers for the education market. His funding partners included Texan entrepreneur Ross Perot and Canon Inc., a Japanese electronics company. Although the NeXT computer was notable for its engineering design, it was eclipsed by less costly computers from competitors such as Sun Microsystems, Inc. In the early 1990s Jobs focused the company on its innovative software system, NEXTSTEP.\\nMeanwhile, in 1986 Jobs acquired a controlling interest in Pixar, a computer graphics firm that had been founded as a division of Lucasfilm Ltd., the production company of Hollywood movie director George Lucas. Over the following decade Jobs built Pixar into a major animation studio that, among other achievements, produced the first full-length feature film to be completely computer-animated, Toy Story, in 1995. Pixar’s public stock offering that year made Jobs, for the first time, a billionaire. He eventually sold the studio to the Disney Company in 2006.'}, {'title': 'Apple Inc. | History, Products, Headquarters, & Facts | Britannica Money', 'url': 'https://www.britannica.com/money/Apple-Inc', 'content': \"In January 1977, with Markkula providing his expertise and seed funding of $250,000, Apple Inc. was incorporated. Apple II, the company's next product, was released in April 1977 and became the first widely distributed microcomputer. It was a commercial success; some 5 or 6 million units were sold over the next decade.\", 'score': 0.9444849, 'raw_content': 'Apple Inc.\\nApple Inc.,\\nAmerican manufacturer of personal computers, smartphones, tablet computers, computer peripherals, and computer software\\xa0and one of the most recognizable\\xa0brands in the world. It was the first successful personal computer company and the popularizer of the graphical user interface. Headquarters are located in Cupertino, California.\\nGarage start-up\\nApple Inc. had its genesis in the lifelong dream of Stephen G. Wozniak to build his own computer—a dream that was made suddenly feasible with the arrival in 1975 of the first commercially successful microcomputer, the Altair 8800, which came as a kit and used the recently invented microprocessor chip. Encouraged by his friends at the Homebrew Computer Club, a San Francisco Bay area group centred around the Altair, Wozniak quickly came up with a plan for his own microcomputer. In 1976, when the Hewlett-Packard Company, where Wozniak was an engineering intern, expressed no interest in his design, Wozniak, then 26 years old, together with a former high-school classmate, 21-year-old Steve Jobs, moved production operations to the Jobs family garage. Jobs and Wozniak named their company Apple. For working capital, Jobs sold his Volkswagen minibus and Wozniak his programmable calculator. Their first model was simply a working circuit board, but at Jobs’s insistence the 1977 version was a stand-alone machine in a custom-molded plastic case, in contrast to the forbidding steel boxes of other early machines. This Apple II also offered a colour display and other features that made Wozniak’s creation the first microcomputer that appealed to the average person.\\nCommercial success\\nThough he was a brash business novice whose appearance still bore traces of his hippie past, Jobs understood that in order for the company to grow, it would require professional management and substantial funding. He convinced Regis McKenna, a well-known public relations specialist for the semiconductor industry, to represent the company; he also secured an investment from Michael Markkula, a wealthy veteran of the Intel Corporation who became Apple’s largest shareholder and an influential member of Apple’s board of directors. The company became an instant success, particularly after Wozniak invented a disk controller that allowed the addition of a low-cost floppy disk drive that made information storage and retrieval fast and reliable. With room to store and manipulate data, the Apple II became the computer of choice for legions of amateur programmers. Most notably, in 1979 two Bostonians—Dan Bricklin and Bob Frankston—introduced the first personal computer spreadsheet, VisiCalc, creating what would later be known as a “killer app” (application): a software program so useful that it propels hardware sales.\\nWhile VisiCalc opened up the small-business and consumer market for the Apple II, another important early market was primary educational institutions. By a combination of aggressive discounts and donations (and an absence of any early competition), Apple established a commanding presence among educational institutions, contributing to its platform’s dominance of primary-school software well into the 1990s.\\nCompetition from IBM\\nApple’s profits and size grew at a historic rate: by 1980 the company netted over $100 million and had more than 1,000 employees. Its public offering in December was the biggest since 1956, when the Ford Motor Company had gone public. (Indeed, by the end of 1980, Apple’s valuation of nearly $2 billion was greater than Ford’s.) However, Apple would soon face competition from the computer industry’s leading player, International Business Machines Corporation. IBM had waited for the personal computer market to grow before introducing its own line of personal computers, the IBM PC, in 1981. IBM broke with its tradition of using only proprietary hardware components and software and built a machine from readily available components, including the Intel microprocessor, and used DOS (disk operating system) from the Microsoft Corporation. Because other manufacturers could use the same hardware components that IBM used, as well as license DOS from Microsoft, new software developers could count on a wide IBM PC-compatible market for their software. Soon the new system had its own killer app: the Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet, which won an instant constituency in the business community—a market that the Apple II had failed to penetrate.\\nMacintosh and the first affordable GUI\\nApple had its own plan to regain leadership: a sophisticated new generation of computers that would be dramatically easier to use. In 1979 Jobs had led a team of engineers to see the innovations created at the Xerox Corporation’s Palo Alto (California) Research Center (PARC). There they were shown the first functional graphical user interface (GUI), featuring on-screen windows, a pointing device known as a mouse, and the use of icons, or pictures, to replace the awkward protocols required by all other computers. Apple immediately incorporated these ideas into two new computers: Lisa, released in 1983, and the lower-cost Macintosh, released in 1984. Jobs himself took over the latter project, insisting that the computer should be not merely great but “insanely great.” The result was a revelation—perfectly in tune with the unconventional, science-fiction-esque television commercial that introduced the Macintosh during the broadcast of the 1984 Super Bowl—a $2,500 computer unlike any that preceded it.'}, {'title': 'Steve Jobs: Biography, Apple Cofounder, Entrepreneur', 'url': 'https://www.biography.com/business-leaders/steve-jobs', 'content': 'Entrepreneurs\\nSuge Knight\\nJimmy Buffett\\nJimmy Dean\\nRupert Murdoch\\nEnzo Ferrari\\nThe Tragic True Story of the ‘Ferrari’ Movie\\nWho Is Music Mogul Scooter Braun?\\nSelena Gomez\\nThe 15 Richest Actors in the World\\nHow Mattel Cofounder Ruth Handler Created Barbie\\nBarbie\\nThe True, Disputed Story Behind “Flamin’ Hot”\\nA Part of Hearst Digital Media\\n Apple hit a market capitalization of $3 trillion in January 2022, meaning Jobs’ initial stake in the company from 1980 would have been worth about $330 billion—enough to comfortably make him the richest person in the world over Tesla founder Elon Musk had he been alive.

Born in 1955 to two University of Wisconsin graduate students who gave him up for adoption, Jobs was smart but directionless, dropping out of college and experimenting with different pursuits before cofounding Apple with Steve Wozniak in 1976. Jobs left the company in 1985, launching Pixar Animation Studios, then returned to Apple more than a decade later. The tech giant’s revolutionary products, which include the iPhone, iPad, and iPod, have dictated the evolution of modern technology. Jobs died in 2011 following a long battle with pancreatic cancer.\\nQuick Facts\\nFULL NAME: Steven Paul JobsBORN: February 24, 1955DIED: October 5, 2011BIRTHPLACE: San Francisco, CaliforniaSPOUSE: Laurene Powell (1991-2011)CHILDREN: Lisa, Reed, Erin, and EveASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Pisces\\nSteve Jobs’ Parents and Adoption\\nSteve Jobs was born on February 24, 1955, in San Francisco to Joanne Schieble (later Joanne Simpson) and Abdulfattah “John” Jandali, two University of Wisconsin graduate students. The couple gave up their unnamed son for adoption. As an infant, Jobs was adopted by Clara and Paul Jobs and named Steven Paul Jobs. Clara worked as an accountant, and Paul was a Coast Guard veteran and machinist.\\nJobs’ biological father, Jandali, was a Syrian political science professor. His biological mother, Schieble, worked as a speech therapist. Shortly after Jobs was placed for adoption, his biological parents married and had another child, Mona Simpson. It was not until Jobs was 27 that he was able to uncover information on his biological parents.\\nEarly Life and Education\\nJobs lived with his adoptive family in Mountain View, California, within the area that would later become known as Silicon Valley. He was curious from childhood, sometimes to his detriment. According to the BBC’s Science Focus magazine, Jobs was taken to the emergency room twice as a toddler—once after sticking a pin into an electrical socket and burning his hand, and another time because he had ingested poison. His mother Clara had taught him to read by the time he started kindergarten.\\nAs a boy, Jobs and his father worked on electronics in the family garage. Paul showed his son how to take apart and reconstruct electronics, a hobby that instilled confidence, tenacity, and mechanical prowess in young Jobs.\\nAlthough Jobs was always an intelligent and innovative thinker, his youth was riddled with frustrations over formal schooling. Jobs was a prankster in elementary school due to boredom, and his fourth-grade teacher needed to bribe him to study. Jobs tested so well, however, that administrators wanted to skip him ahead to high school—a proposal that his parents declined.\\nWhile attending Homestead High School, Jobs joined the Explorer’s Club at Hewlett-Packard. It was there that he saw a computer for the first time. He even picked up a summer job with HP after calling company cofounder Bill Hewlett to ask for parts for a frequency counter he was building. It was at HP that a teenaged Jobs met he met his future partner and cofounder of Apple Computer Steve Wozniak, who was attending the University of California, Berkeley.\\nAfter high school, Jobs enrolled at Reed College in Portland, Oregon. Lacking direction, he withdrew from college after six months and spent the next year and a half dropping in on creative classes at the school. Jobs later recounted how one course in calligraphy developed his love of typography.\\nIn 1974, Jobs took a position as a video game designer with Atari. Several months later, he left the company to find spiritual enlightenment in India, traveling further and experimenting with psychedelic drugs.\\nFounding and Leaving Apple Computer Inc.\\nIn 1976, when Jobs was just 21, he and Wozniak started Apple Computer Inc. in the Jobs’ family garage. Jobs sold his Volkswagen bus and Wozniak his beloved scientific calculator to fund their entrepreneurial venture. Through Apple, the men are credited with revolutionizing the computer industry by democratizing the technology and making machines smaller, cheaper, intuitive, and accessible to everyday consumers.\\nWozniak conceived of a series of user-friendly personal computers, and—with Jobs in charge of marketing—Apple initially marketed the computers for $666.66 each. The Apple I earned the corporation around $774,000. Three years after the release of Apple’s second model, the Apple II, the company’s sales increased exponentially to $139 million.\\nIn 1980, Apple Computer became a publicly-traded company, with a market value of $1.2 billion by the end of its first day of trading. However, the next several products from Apple suffered significant design flaws, resulting in recalls and consumer disappointment. IBM suddenly surpassed Apple in sales, and Apple had to compete with an IBM/PC-dominated business world.\\nJobs looked to marketing expert John Sculley of Pepsi-Cola to take over the role of CEO for Apple in 1983. The next year, Apple released the Macintosh, marketing the computer as a piece of a counterculture lifestyle: romantic, youthful, creative. But despite positive sales and performance superior to IBM’s PCs, the Macintosh was still not IBM-compatible.\\nSculley believed Jobs was hurting Apple, and the company’s executives began to phase him out. Not actually having had an official title with the company he cofounded, Jobs was pushed into a more marginalized position and left Apple in 1985.\\nCreating NeXT\\nAfter leaving Apple in 1985, Jobs personally invested $12 million to begin a new hardware and software enterprise called NeXT Inc. The company introduced its first computer in 1988, with Jobs hoping it would appeal to universities and researchers. But with a base price of $6,500, the machine was far out of the range of most potential buyers.\\nThe company’s operating system NeXTSTEP fared better, with programmers using it to develop video games like Quake and Doom. Tim Berners-Lee, who created the first web browser, used an NeXT computer. However, the company struggled to appeal to\\nmainstream America, and Apple eventually bought the company in 1996 for $429 million.\\nSteve Jobs and Pixar\\nIn 1986, Jobs purchased an animation company from George Lucas, which later became Pixar Animation Studios. Believing in Pixar’s potential, Jobs initially invested $50 million of his own money in the company.\\nThe studio went on to produce wildly popular movies such as Toy Story (1995), Finding Nemo (2003), The Incredibles (2004), Cars (2006), and Up (2009). Pixar merged with Disney in 2006, which made Jobs the largest shareholder of Disney. As of June 2022, Pixar films had collectively grossed $14.7 billion at the global box office.\\nReturning to and Reinventing Apple\\nIn 1997, Jobs returned to his post as Apple’s CEO. Just as Jobs instigated Apple’s success in the 1970s, he is credited with revitalizing the company in the 1990s.\\nWith a new management team, altered stock options, and a self-imposed annual salary of $1 a year, Jobs put Apple back on track. Jobs’ ingenious products like the iMac, effective branding campaigns, and stylish designs caught the attention of consumers once again.\\nIn the ensuing years, Apple introduced such revolutionary products as the Macbook Air, iPod, and iPhone, all of which dictated the evolution of technology. Almost immediately after Apple released a new product, competitors scrambled to produce comparable technologies. To mark its expanded product offerings, the company officially rebranded as Apple Inc. in 2007.\\nApple’s quarterly reports improved significantly that year: Stocks were worth $199.99 a share—a record-breaking number at that time—and the company boasted a staggering $1.58 billion profit, an $18 billion surplus in the bank, and zero debt.\\nIn 2008, fueled by iTunes and iPod sales, Apple became the second-biggest music retailer in America behind Walmart. Apple has also been ranked No. 1 on Fortune’s list of America’s Most Admired Companies, as well as No. 1 among Fortune 500 companies for returns to shareholders.\\nApple has released dozens of versions of the iPhone since its 2007 debut. In February 2023, an unwrapped first generation phone sold at auction for more than $63,000.\\nNet Worth\\nAccording to Forbes, Jobs’ net worth peaked at $8.3 billion shortly before he died in 2011. Celebrity Net Worth estimates it was as high as $10.2 billion.\\nApple hit a market capitalization of $3 trillion in January 2022, meaning Jobs’ initial stake in the company from 1980 would have been worth about $330 billion—enough to comfortably make him the richest person in the world over Tesla founder Elon Musk had he been alive. But according to the New York Post, Jobs sold off all but one of his Apple shares when he left the company in 1985.\\nMost of Jobs’ net worth came from a roughly 8 percent share in Disney he acquired when he sold Pixar in 2006. Based on Disney’s 2022 value, that share—which he passed onto his wife—is worth $22 billion.\\nWife and Children\\nJobs and Laurene Powell married on March 18, 1991. The pair met in the early 1990s at Stanford business school, where Powell was an MBA student. They lived together in Palo Alto with their three children: Reed (born September 22, 1991), Erin (born August 19, 1995), and Eve (born July 9, 1998).\\nJobs also fathered a daughter, Lisa Brennan-Jobs, with girlfriend Chrisann Brennan on May 17, 1978, when he was 23. He denied paternity of his daughter in court documents, claiming he was sterile. In her memoir Small Fry, Lisa wrote DNA tests revealed that she and Jobs were a match in 1980, and he was required to begin making paternity payments to her financially struggling mother. Jobs didn’t initiate a relationship with his daughter until she was 7 years old. When she was a teenager, Lisa came to live with her father. In 2011, Jobs said, “I’ve done a lot of things I’m not proud of, such as getting my girlfriend pregnant when I was 23 and the way I handled that.”\\nPancreatic Cancer Diagnosis and Health Challenges\\nIn 2003, Jobs discovered that he had a neuroendocrine tumor, a rare but operable form of pancreatic cancer. Instead of immediately opting for surgery, Jobs chose to alter his pesco-vegetarian diet while weighing Eastern treatment options.\\nFor nine months, Jobs postponed surgery, making Apple’s board of directors nervous. Executives feared that shareholders would pull their stock if word got out that the CEO was ill. But in the end, Jobs’ confidentiality took precedence over shareholder disclosure.\\nIn 2004, Jobs had successful surgery to remove the pancreatic tumor. True to form, Jobs disclosed little about his health in subsequent years.\\nEarly in 2009, reports circulated about Jobs’ weight loss, some predicting his health issues had returned, which included a liver transplant. Jobs responded to these concerns by stating he was dealing with a hormone imbalance. Days later, he went on a six-month leave of absence.\\nIn an email message to employees, Jobs said his “health-related issues are more complex” than he thought, then named Tim Cook, Apple’s then–chief operating officer, as “responsible for Apple’s day-today operations.”\\nAfter nearly a year out of the spotlight, Jobs delivered a keynote address at an invite-only Apple event on September 9, 2009. He continued to serve as master of ceremonies, which included the unveiling of the iPad, throughout much of 2010.\\nIn January 2011, Jobs announced he was going on medical leave. In August, he resigned as CEO of Apple, handing the reins to Cook.\\nDeath and Last Words\\nJobs died at age 56 in his home in Palo Alto, California, on October 5, 2011. His official cause of death was listed as respiratory arrest related to his years-long battle with pancreatic cancer.\\nThe New York Times reported that in his final weeks, Jobs had become so weak that he struggled to walk up the stairs in his home. Still, he was able to say goodbye to some of his longtime colleagues, including Disney CEO Bob Iger; speak with his biographer; and offer advice to Apple executives about the unveiling of the iPhone 4S.\\nIn a eulogy for Jobs, sister Mona Simpson wrote that just before dying, Jobs looked for a long time at his sister, Patty, then his wife and children, then past them, and said his last words: “Oh wow. Oh wow. Oh wow.”\\nJobs’ closest family and friends remembered him at a small gathering, then on October 16, a funeral for Jobs was held on the campus of Stanford University. Notable attendees included Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates; singer Joan Baez, who once dated Jobs; former Vice President Al Gore; actor Tim Allen; and News Corporation chairman Rupert Murdoch.\\nJobs is buried in an unmarked grave at Alta Mesa Memorial Park in Palo Alto. Upon the release of the 2015 film Steve Jobs, fans traveled to the cemetery to find the site. Because the cemetery is not allowed to disclose the grave’s location, many left messages for Jobs in a memorial book instead.\\nMovies and Book about Steve Jobs\\nBefore his death, Jobs granted author and journalist Walter Isaacson permission to write his official biography. Jobs sat for more than 40 interviews with the Isaacson, who also talked to more than 100 of Jobs’ family, friends, and colleagues. Initially scheduled for a November 2011 release date, Steve Jobs hit shelves on October 24, just 19 days after Jobs died.\\nJobs’ life has been the subject of two major films. The first, released in 2013, was simply titled Jobs and starred Ashton Kutcher as Jobs and Josh Gad as Apple cofounder Steve Wozniak. Wozniak told The Verge in 2013 he was approached about working on the film but couldn’t because, “I read a script as far as I could stomach it and felt it was crap.” Although he praised the casting, he told Gizmodo he felt his and Jobs’ personalities were inaccurately portrayed.\\nInstead, Wozniak worked with Sony Pictures on the second film, Steve Jobs, that was adapted from Isaacson’s biography and released in 2015. It starred Michael Fassbender as Jobs and Seth Rogen as Wozniak. Fassbender was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor, and co-star Kate Winslet was nominated for Best Supporting Actress for her role as Apple and NeXT marketing executive Joanna Hoffman.\\nIn 2015, filmmaker Alex Gibney examined Jobs’ life and legacy in the documentary Steve Jobs: The Man in the Machine.\\nQuotes\\nThe Biography.com staff is a team of people-obsessed and news-hungry editors with decades of collective experience.

Referred to in the media as the \"Baadshah of Bollywood\" and \"King Khan\",[a] he has appeared in more than 100 films, and earned numerous accolades, including 14 Filmfare Awards. He has been awarded the Padma Shri by the Government of India, as well as the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and Legion of Honour by the Government of France. Khan has a significant following in Asia and the Indian diaspora worldwide. In terms of audience size and income, several media outlets have described him as one of the most successful film stars in the world.[b] Many of his films thematise Indian national identity and connections with diaspora communities, or gender, racial, social and religious differences and grievances.\\nKhan began his career with appearances in several television series in the late 1980s and made his Bollywood debut in 1992 with the musical romance Deewana. He was initially recognised for playing villainous roles in the films Baazigar (1993) and Darr (1993). Khan established himself by starring in a series of top-grossing romantic films, including Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (1995), Dil To Pagal Hai (1997), Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998), Mohabbatein (2000), Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... (2001), Kal Ho Naa Ho (2003), Veer-Zaara (2004) and Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna (2006). He earned critical acclaim for his portrayal of an alcoholic in the period romantic drama Devdas (2002), a NASA scientist in the social drama Swades (2004), a hockey coach in the sports drama Chak De! India (2007), and a man with Asperger syndrome in the drama My Name Is Khan (2010). Further commercial successes came with the romances Om Shanti Om (2007) and Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi (2008), and with his expansion to comedies in Chennai Express (2013) and Happy New Year (2014). Following a brief setback and hiatus, Khan made a career comeback with the 2023 action thrillers Pathaan and Jawan, both of which rank among the highest-grossing Indian films.\\nAs of 2015, Khan is co-chairman of the motion picture production company Red Chillies Entertainment and its subsidiaries and is the co-owner of the Indian Premier League cricket team Kolkata Knight Riders and the Caribbean Premier League team Trinbago Knight Riders. The media often label him as \"Brand SRK\" because of his many endorsements and entrepreneurship ventures. He is a frequent television presenter and stage show performer. Khan\\'s philanthropic endeavours have provided health care and disaster relief, and he was honoured with UNESCO\\'s Pyramide con Marni award in 2011 for his support of children\\'s education and the World Economic Forum\\'s Crystal Award in 2018 for advocating for women\\'s and children\\'s rights in India. He regularly features in listings of the most influential people in Indian culture, and in 2008, Newsweek named him one of their fifty most powerful people in the world. In 2022, Khan was voted one of the 50 greatest actors of all time in a readers\\' poll by Empire, and in 2023, Time named him as one of the most influential people in the world.\\nEarly life and family\\nParents\\nKhan\\'s father, Mir Taj Mohammed Khan, was an Indian independence activist from Peshawar who campaigned alongside the Khudai Khidmatgar, a nonviolent resistance movement led by Abdul Ghaffar Khan that sought a united and independent India.[1][2] Mir was a follower of Abdul Ghaffar Khan,[3] and affiliated with the Indian National Congress.[4] He was also the cousin of the major general in the Indian National Army Shah Nawaz Khan.[c]\\nAccording to Khan his paternal grandfather, Mir Jan Muhammad Khan, was an ethnic Pashtun (Pathan) from Afghanistan.[7][4][8] However, his paternal cousins in Peshawar later clarified that the family speaks Hindko and is originally from Kashmir, from where they settled in Peshawar centuries back, contradicting the claim that his grandfather was a Pashtun from Afghanistan.[4][9] As of 2010, Khan\\'s paternal family was still living in the Shah Wali Qataal area of Peshawar\\'s Qissa Khwani Bazaar.[4]\\nIn 1946, Mir moved to Delhi to study law at Delhi University.[10] When the partition of India occurred in 1947, he was forced to stay in Delhi, and did not return to Peshawar until many years later.[11] Khan\\'s mother, Lateef Fatima, a magistrate, was the daughter of a senior government engineer.[12][c][13] His parents were married in 1959.[14]\\nEarly life\\nKhan was born on 2 November 1965 into a Muslim family in New Delhi.[15] He spent the first five years of his life in Mangalore, where his maternal grandfather, Iftikhar Ahmed, served as chief engineer of the port in the 1960s.[16][17][d] Khan has described himself on Twitter as \"half Hyderabadi (mother), half Pathan (father), and some Kashmiri (grandmother)\".[19]\\nKhan grew up in the Rajendra Nagar neighbourhood of New Delhi.[20] His father had several business ventures including a restaurant, and the family lived a middle-class life in rented apartments.[21] Khan attended St. Columba\\'s School in central Delhi where he excelled in his studies and in sports such as hockey and football,[22] and received the school\\'s highest award, the Sword of Honour.[21] Initially Khan aspired to pursue a career in sports, however owing to a shoulder injury in his early years meant that he could no longer play.[23] Instead, in his youth, he acted in stage plays and received praise for his imitations of Bollywood actors, of which his favourites were Dilip Kumar, Amitabh Bachchan, and Mumtaz.[24] One of his childhood friends and acting partners was Amrita Singh, who became a Bollywood actress.[25] Khan enrolled at Hansraj College (1985–88) to earn his bachelor\\'s degree in economics, but spent much of his time at Delhi\\'s Theatre Action Group (TAG),[26] where he studied acting under the mentorship of theatre director Barry John.[27][28] After Hansraj, he began studying for a master\\'s degree in mass communication at Jamia Millia Islamia, but left to pursue his acting career.[29] He also attended the National School of Drama in Delhi during his early career in Bollywood.[30]\\nHis father died of cancer in 1981,[e] and his mother died in 1991 from complications of diabetes.[33] After the death of their parents, his older sister, Shahnaz Lalarukh (born 1960)[34] fell into a depressed state and Khan took on the responsibility of caring for her.[31][35] Shahnaz continues to live with her brother and his family in their Mumbai mansion.[36]\\nActing career\\n1988–1992: Television and film debut\\nKhan\\'s first starring role was in Lekh Tandon\\'s television series Dil Dariya, which began shooting in 1988, but production delays led to the Raj Kumar Kapoor directed 1989 series Fauji becoming his television debut instead.[37] In the series, which depicted a realistic look at the training of army cadets, he played the leading role of Abhimanyu Rai.[38][39] This led to further appearances in Aziz Mirza\\'s television series Circus (1989–90) and Mani Kaul\\'s miniseries Idiot (1992).[40] Khan also played minor parts in the serials Umeed (1989) and Wagle Ki Duniya (1988–90),[40] and in the English-language television film In Which Annie Gives It Those Ones (1989).[41] His appearances in these serials led critics to compare his look and acting style with those of the film actor Dilip Kumar,[42] but Khan was not interested in film acting at the time, thinking that he was not good enough.[40][43]\\nKhan changed his decision to act in films in April 1991,[44] citing it as a way to escape the grief of his mother\\'s death.[45] He moved from Delhi to Mumbai to pursue a full-time career in Bollywood and was quickly signed to four films.[44] His first offer was for Hema Malini\\'s directorial debut Dil Aashna Hai,[30][38] and by June, he had started his first shoot.[46] His film debut was in Deewana, which was released in June 1992.[47] In it he starred alongside Divya Bharti as the second male lead behind Rishi Kapoor. Deewana became a box office hit and launched Khan\\'s Bollywood career;[48] he earned the Filmfare Best Male Debut Award for his performance.[49] Also released in 1992 were Khan\\'s first films as the male lead, Chamatkar, Dil Aashna Hai, and the comedy Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman, which was his first of many collaborations with the actress Juhi Chawla.[50] His initial film roles saw him play characters who displayed energy and enthusiasm. According to Arnab Ray of Daily News and Analysis, Khan brought a new kind of acting as he was \"sliding down stairs on a slab of ice, cartwheeling, somersaulting, lips trembling, eyes trembling, bringing to the screen the kind of physical energy\\xa0... visceral, intense, maniacal one moment and cloyingly boyish the next.\"[51]\\n1993–1994: Anti-hero\\nAmong his 1993 releases, Khan garnered the most appreciation for portraying villainous roles in two box office hits: a murderer in Baazigar, and an obsessive lover in Darr.[52] The former, in which Khan played an ambiguous avenger who murders his girlfriend, shocked Indian audiences with an unexpected violation of the standard Bollywood formula.[53] In The Cambridge Companion to Modern Indian Culture, Sonal Khullar called the character \"the consummate anti-hero\".[54] His performance in Baazigar, which would be his first of many appearances with actress Kajol, won Khan his first Filmfare Award for Best Actor.[55] In 2003, the Encyclopaedia of Hindi Cinema stated that Khan \"defied the image of the conventional hero in both these films and created his own version of the revisionist hero\".[55] Darr marked the first of Khan\\'s many collaborations with filmmaker Yash Chopra and his company Yash Raj Films. Khan\\'s stammering and the use of the phrase \"I love you, K-k-k-Kiran\" were popular with audiences.[56] Malini Mannath of The Indian Express argued that he \"walks away with the acting honours in yet another negative role\".[57] For Darr he received a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Performance in a Negative Role, also known as the Best Villain Award, but lost to Paresh Rawal for Sir.[58] Also in 1993, Khan performed a nude scene with Deepa Sahi in Maya Memsaab, although parts of it were censored by the Central Board of Film Certification.[59] The ensuing controversy prompted him to eschew such scenes in future roles.[60]\\nIn 1994, Khan played a love-struck musician in Kundan Shah\\'s comedy-drama film Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa opposite Deepak Tijori and Suchitra Krishnamurthy, which he later professed was his favourite role. His performance earned him a Filmfare Critics Award for Best Performance, and in a retrospective review from 2004, Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com referred to it as Khan\\'s best performance, calling him \"spontaneous, vulnerable, boyish, mischievous and acting straight from the heart\".[61] Also in 1994, Khan won the Filmfare Best Villain Award for his role as an obsessive lover in Anjaam, co-starring Madhuri Dixit.[55] At the time, playing antagonistic roles was considered risky to a leading man\\'s career in mainstream Hindi cinema. Arnab Ray subsequently credited Khan for taking \"insane risks\" and \"pushing the envelope\" by choosing to play such characters, through which he established his career.[51] The director Mukul S. Anand called him \"the new face of the industry\" at the time.[45]\\n1995–1998: Romantic roles\\nKhan starred in seven films in 1995, the first of which was Rakesh Roshan\\'s melodramatic thriller Karan Arjun. Co-starring Salman Khan and Kajol, it became the second-highest-grossing film of the year in India.[62] His most significant release that year was Aditya Chopra\\'s directorial debut, the romance Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, in which he played a young Non-resident Indian (NRI) who falls in love with Kajol\\'s character during a trip across Europe. Khan was initially reticent to portray the role of a lover, but this film is credited with establishing him as a \"romantic hero\".[63] Lauded by both critics and the public, it became the year\\'s highest grossing production in India and abroad and was declared an \"all time blockbuster\" by Box Office India,[62][64] with an estimated lifetime gross of ₹2 billion (US$61.68 million) worldwide.[65][66] It is the longest-running film in the history of Indian cinema; it is still showing at the Maratha Mandir theatre in Mumbai after more than 1000 weeks as of early 2015.[67][68] The film won ten Filmfare Awards, including the second of Khan\\'s Best Actor Awards.[55] The director and critic Raja Sen said, \"Khan gives a fabulous performance, redefining the lover for the 1990s with great panache. He\\'s cool and flippant, but sincere enough to appeal to the [audience]. The performance itself is, like the best in the business, played well enough to come across as effortless, as non-acting.\"[69]\\nIn 1996, all four of Khan\\'s releases failed critically and commercially,[70] but the following year, his starring role opposite Aditya Pancholi and Juhi Chawla in Aziz Mirza\\'s romantic comedy Yes Boss earned him accolades that included a Filmfare Best Actor nomination.[58] Later in 1997, he starred in Subhash Ghai\\'s diasporic-themed social drama Pardes,[71] portraying Arjun, a musician facing a moral dilemma. India Today cites it as one of the first major Bollywood pictures to succeed in the United States.[72] Khan\\'s final release of 1997 was the second collaboration with Yash Chopra in the popular musical romance Dil To Pagal Hai. He portrayed Rahul, a stage director caught in a love triangle between Madhuri Dixit and Karisma Kapoor. The film and his performance met with critical praise, winning Khan his third Best Actor Award at Filmfare.[55]\\nKhan performed the lead role in three films and made one special appearance in 1998. In his first release of the year, he played a double role opposite Juhi Chawla and Sonali Bendre in Mahesh Bhatt\\'s action comedy Duplicate, the first of his many collaborations with Yash Johar\\'s production company Dharma Productions. The film was not well received,[73] but India Today lauded Khan for his energetic performance.[74] The same year, Khan won critical praise for his performance as an All India Radio correspondent who develops an infatuation for a mysterious terrorist (Manisha Koirala) in Dil Se..,[75] the third instalment of Mani Ratnam\\'s trilogy of terror films.[76][77] In his final release of the year, he portrayed a college student in Karan Johar\\'s romance Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, in which he was involved in a love triangle along with Kajol and Rani Mukerji. The writer Anjana Motihar Chandra has referred to the picture as the blockbuster of the 1990s, a \"pot-pourri of romance, comedy, and entertainment.\"[78] Khan won the Best Actor award at the Filmfare Awards ceremony for the second consecutive year,[55] although he and several critics believed his performance to have been overshadowed by that of Kajol.[79]\\nThe roles in this phase of his career, and the series of romantic comedies and family dramas that followed, earned Khan widespread adulation from audiences, particularly teenagers,[80] and according to the author Anupama Chopra, established him as an icon of romance in India.[81][82] He continued to have frequent professional associations with Yash Chopra, Aditya Chopra, and Karan Johar, who moulded his image and made him into a superstar.[83] Khan became a romantic leading man without ever actually kissing any of his co-stars,[81] although he broke this rule in 2012, after strong urging by Yash Chopra.[84]\\n1999–2003: Career fluctuations\\nKhan\\'s only release in 1999 was Baadshah, in which he starred opposite Twinkle Khanna. Although the film underperformed at the box office,[85] it earned him a Filmfare Award nomination for Best Performance in a Comic Role, which he lost to Govinda for Haseena Maan Jaayegi.[58] Khan became a producer in 1999 in a collaboration with the actress Juhi Chawla and the director Aziz Mirza for a production company called Dreamz Unlimited.[86] The company\\'s first production, Phir Bhi Dil Hai Hindustani (2000), starring Khan and Chawla, was a commercial failure.[87] It was released one week after Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai, starring Hrithik Roshan, then a newcomer, who critics believed overshadowed Khan.[88] Swapna Mitter of Rediff.com spoke of Khan\\'s predictable mannerisms, saying \"Frankly, it\\'s high time he innovated his act a little.\"[89] Khan did a supporting role in Kamal Haasan\\'s Hey Ram (2000), which was made simultaneously in Tamil and Hindi. He thereby made his Tamil debut by playing the role of an archaeologist named Amjad Khan.[90] He performed free of charge as he wanted to work with Haasan.[91][92] On Khan\\'s performance, T. Krithika Reddy of The Hindu wrote, \"Shah Rukh Khan, as usual comes up with an impeccable performance.\"[90]\\nIn 2001, Dreamz Unlimited attempted a comeback with Khan portraying the title role in Santosh Sivan\\'s historical epic Aśoka, a partly fictionalised account of the life of emperor Ashoka. The film was screened at the Venice Film Festival and the 2001 Toronto International Film Festival to a positive response,[93] but it performed poorly at Indian box offices.[94] As losses continued to mount for the production company,[88] Khan was forced to close srkworld.com, a company that he had started along with Dreamz Unlimited.[95] In December 2001, Khan suffered a spinal injury while performing an action sequence for a special appearance in Krishna Vamsi\\'s Shakti: The Power.[96] He was subsequently diagnosed with a prolapsed disc, and attempted multiple alternative therapies. None of these provided a permanent solution to the injury, which caused him severe pain while shooting several of his films.[96][97] By the beginning of 2003, his condition had worsened to the point that he had to undergo anterior cervical discectomy and fusion surgery at Wellington Hospital, London.[98][99][100] Khan resumed shooting in June 2003, but he reduced his workload and the number of film roles he accepted annually.[97]\\nSuccesses during this time included Aditya Chopra\\'s Mohabbatein (2000), and Karan Johar\\'s family drama Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... (2001),[87][101] which Khan cites as a turning point in his career.[102] Both films co-starred Amitabh Bachchan as an authoritarian figure, and presented ideological struggles between the two men.[103][104] Khan\\'s performances in the films were met with wide public appreciation, and he was awarded his second Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor for Mohabbatein.[58][105] Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... remained the top-grossing Indian production of all time in the overseas market for the next five years.[106]\\nIn 2002, Khan played the title role as a rebellious alcoholic opposite Aishwarya Rai and Madhuri Dixit in Sanjay Leela Bhansali\\'s period romance Devdas. At a cost of over ₹500 million (US$10.29 million), it was the most expensive Bollywood film ever made at the time,[107] and became a box office success, earning approximately ₹1.68 billion ($35\\xa0million) worldwide.[108] The film earned numerous accolades including 10 Filmfare Awards, with Best Actor for Khan,[49] and a BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language.[109] Khan next starred in Kal Ho Naa Ho (2003), a comedy-drama written by Karan Johar and set in New York City, which became the second-highest-grossing film domestically and the top-grossing Bollywood film in external markets that year.[101][110] Co-starring with Jaya Bachchan, Saif Ali Khan, and Preity Zinta, Khan received critical praise for his portrayal of Aman Mathur, a man with a fatal heart disease, with critics praising his emotional impact upon audiences.[111] Conflict broke out between Khan and the other partners of Dreamz Unlimited over the failure to cast Juhi Chawla in their 2003 production of Aziz Mirza\\'s Chalte Chalte, and they parted ways, despite the film\\'s success.[112]\\n2004–2009: Comeback\\n2004 was a critically and commercially successful year for Khan. He transformed Dreamz Unlimited into Red Chillies Entertainment, adding his wife Gauri as a producer.[113] In the company\\'s first production, he starred in Farah Khan\\'s directorial debut, the masala film Main Hoon Na. A fictionalised account of India–Pakistan relations, it was viewed by some commentators as a conscious effort to move away from the stereotypical portrayal of Pakistan as the constant villain.[114] Khan then played an Indian Air Force pilot who falls in love with a Pakistani woman (Preity Zinta) in Yash Chopra\\'s romance film Veer-Zaara, which was screened at the 55th Berlin Film Festival to critical praise.[115] It was the highest earning film of 2004 in India, with a worldwide gross of over ₹940 million (US$20.74 million), and Main Hoon Na was the second-highest earner with ₹680 million (US$15.01 million).[106][116]\\nIn his final release of 2004, Khan starred as a NASA scientist who patriotically returns to India to rekindle his roots in Ashutosh Gowariker\\'s social drama Swades (meaning \"Homeland\"), which became the first Indian picture to be shot inside the NASA research centre at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.[117] Film scholar Stephen Teo refers to the picture as an example of \"Bollywoodised realism\", displaying a transcendence in conventional narrative and audience expectation in Hindi cinema.[118] In December 2013, The Times of India reported that Khan found filming the picture such an emotionally overwhelming and life-changing experience that he had still not viewed the film.[119] Derek Elley of Variety found Khan\\'s performance \"unsettling\" as \"a self-satisfied expatriate determined to bring Western values to poor Indian peasants\",[120] but several film critics, including Jitesh Pillai, believed it to have been his finest acting to date.[121][122] He was nominated for the Filmfare Best Actor Award for all three of his 2004 releases and eventually won the award for Swades.[49][58] Filmfare later included his performance in the 2010 issue of Bollywood\\'s \"Top 80 Iconic Performances\".[123]\\nIn 2005, Khan starred in Amol Palekar\\'s fantasy drama, Paheli. The film was India\\'s submission for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 79th Academy Awards.[124] He later collaborated with Karan Johar for the third time in the musical romantic drama Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna (2006), in which he played an unhappily married man who has an extramarital affair with a married woman. The film, which featured an ensemble cast including Amitabh Bachchan, Abhishek Bachchan, Rani Mukerji, Preity Zinta and Kirron Kher, emerged as India\\'s highest-grossing film in the overseas market,[101] earning more than ₹1.13 billion (US$25.62 million) worldwide.[106] Both his roles in Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna and the action film Don, a remake of the 1978 film of the same name, earned Khan Best Actor nominations at the Filmfare Awards,[125] despite his performance as the titular character in Don being negatively compared to that of Amitabh Bachchan in the original film.[126][127]\\n\"Such great things have happened to such a normal guy like me. I am a nobody who shouldn\\'t have been able to do all this but I have done it. I tell everyone that there\\'s this myth I work for; there is this myth called Shahrukh Khan and I am his employee. I have to live up to that\\xa0... I\\'ll do it, I am an actor. But I can\\'t start believing in this myth.\"\\n—Khan reflecting in 2007 on his position as the Hindi film industry\\'s top star[128]\\nIn 2007, Khan portrayed a disgraced hockey player who coached the Indian women\\'s national hockey team to World Cup success in Yash Raj Films\\' semi-fictional Chak De! India. Bhaichand Patel notes that Khan, who had a background in the sport playing for his university\\'s hockey team,[129] essentially portrayed himself as a \"cosmopolitan, liberal, Indian Muslim\".[130] Faring well in both India and abroad,[106][131] Khan garnered another Filmfare Award for Best Actor for his performance,[49] which Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN considers to have been \"without any of his typical trappings, without any of his trademark quirks\", portraying Kabir Khan \"like a real flesh-and-blood human being\".[132] Filmfare included his performance in their 2010 issue of the \"Top 80 Iconic Performances\".[133] In the same year, Khan starred alongside Arjun Rampal, Deepika Padukone and Shreyas Talpade in Farah Khan\\'s reincarnation melodrama Om Shanti Om, portraying a 1970s junior artiste who is reborn as a 2000s era superstar. The film became the highest grossing Indian motion picture of 2007, both domestically and abroad.[101][134] Om Shanti Om earned Khan his second nomination of the year for Best Actor at Filmfare.[135] Khalid Mohammed from Hindustan Times wrote, \"the enterprise belongs to Shah Rukh Khan, who tackles comedy, high drama and action with his signature style—spontaneous and intuitively intelligent\".[136]\\nKhan collaborated for the third time with Aditya Chopra on the romantic comedy Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi (2008) opposite Anushka Sharma, at that time a newcomer. He played Surinder Sahni, a shy man with low self-esteem, whose love for his young arranged wife (Sharma) causes him to transform himself into Raj, a boisterous alter-ego. Rachel Saltz of The New York Times believed the dual role to have been \"tailor-made\" for Khan, allowing him to display his talents,[137] although Deep Contractor from Epilogue thought Khan displayed greater strength in the role of Surinder and weakness in the role of monologue-prone Raj.[138] In December 2008, Khan suffered a shoulder injury while filming a small role in Mudassar Aziz\\'s Dulha Mil Gaya. He underwent extensive physiotherapy sessions at the time but the pain left him almost immobile and he had arthroscopic surgery in February 2009.[139][140] He performed a special appearance in the 2009 film Billu, playing Bollywood superstar Sahir Khan—a fictionalised version of himself, wherein he performed musical item numbers with actresses Kareena Kapoor, Priyanka Chopra, and Deepika Padukone.[141] As head of the film\\'s production company, Red Chillies, Khan made the call to change the title of the film from Billu Barber to Billu after hairdressers across the country complained that the word \"barber\" was derogatory. The company covered up the offending word on billboards that had already been installed with the original title.[142]\\n2010–2014: Expansion to action and comedy\\nAfter refusing the role that subsequently went to Anil Kapoor in Danny Boyle\\'s Slumdog Millionaire (2008), Khan began shooting My Name Is Khan (2010), his fourth collaboration with director Karan Johar and his sixth with Kajol.[143] The film is based on a true story and set against the backdrop of perceptions of Islam after the 11 September attacks. Khan plays Rizwan Khan, a Muslim suffering from mild Asperger syndrome who sets out on a journey across America to meet the country\\'s president, in a role that film scholar Stephen Teo sees as a \"symbol of assertive rasa values\" and another example of Khan representing NRI identity in global Bollywood.[144] To provide an accurate portrayal of a sufferer without disparagement, Khan spent several months researching his role by reading books, watching videos and talking to people affected by the condition.[145][146] Upon release, My Name is Khan became one of the highest grossing Bollywood films of all time outside India,[106][101] and earned Khan his eighth Filmfare Award for Best Actor,[49] equalling the record for the most wins in the category with actor Dilip Kumar.[147] Jay Wesissberg from Variety noted how Khan portrayed the Asperger\\'s sufferer with \"averted eyes, springy steps, [and] stuttered repetitions of memorized texts\", believing it to have been a \"standout performance sure to receive the Autism Society\\'s gold seal of approval\".[148]\\nIn 2011, Khan starred alongside Arjun Rampal and Kareena Kapoor in Anubhav Sinha\\'s superhero film Ra.One, his first work in this subgenre, as a favour to his children.[149] The film follows the story of a London-based videogame designer who creates a villainous character who escapes into the real world. It was billed as Bollywood\\'s most expensive production; it had an estimated budget of ₹1.25 billion (US$26.78 million).[150][151] Despite negative media coverage of the film\\'s box office performance, Ra.One was a financial success with a gross of ₹2.4 billion (US$51.42 million).[152][153] The film, and Khan\\'s portrayal of a dual role, received mixed reviews; while most critics praised his performance as the robotic superhero G.One, though they criticised his portrayal of the videogame designer Shekhar.[154] Khan\\'s second release of 2011 was Don 2, a sequel to Don (2006).[155] To prepare for his role, Khan exercised extensively and performed most of the stunts himself.[156] His performance earned him positive reviews from critics; Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India said, \"Shah Rukh remains in command and never loses his foothold, neither through the dramatic sequences nor through the action cuts\".[157] The year\\'s highest grossing Bollywood production abroad,[158][159] it was showcased at the 62nd Berlin International Film Festival.[160]\\nKhan\\'s only release in 2012 was Yash Chopra\\'s last picture,[161] the romantic drama Jab Tak Hai Jaan, which saw him once again in a romantic role, starring opposite Katrina Kaif and Anushka Sharma. CNN-IBN considered the overall performance by Khan to have been one of his finest to date, but believed that Khan\\'s first screen kiss of his career with Katrina Kaif, twenty years his junior, was an awkward one.[84][162] Jab Tak Hai Jaan was a moderate financial success earning over ₹2.11 billion (US$39.49 million) worldwide.[163][164] The film was showcased at the 2012 Marrakech International Film Festival in Morocco, along with Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham..., Veer-Zaara, and Don 2.[165] At the following Zee Cine Awards, Khan performed a tribute to the late Yash Chopra along with Kaif, Sharma, and several of Chopra\\'s other past heroines.[166]\\nIn 2013, Khan starred in Rohit Shetty\\'s action comedy Chennai Express for Red Chillies Entertainment, a film which earned mixed critical reviews and a fair amount of criticism for its perceived disparagement of South Indian culture, although the film included a tribute to Tamil cinema star Rajinikanth.[167] The critic Khalid Mohamed thought that Khan overacted in the film and criticised him for \"re-rendering every old trick in the acting book\".[168] Despite the criticism, the film broke many box office records for Hindi films in both India and abroad, surpassing 3 Idiots to briefly become the highest grossing Bollywood film of all time, with a gross of almost ₹4 billion (US$68.26 million) in worldwide ticket sales.[169][170] On International Women\\'s Day in 2013, The Times of India reported that Khan had requested a new convention with the name of his lead female co-stars appearing above his own in the credits. He claimed that the women in his life, including his co-stars, have been the reason for his success.[171] In 2014, the actor was featured in Farah Khan\\'s ensemble action comedy Happy New Year, which co-starred Deepika Padukone, Abhishek Bachchan and Boman Irani; his third collaboration with the director.[172] Although Khan\\'s unidimensional character was criticised,[173] the film became a major commercial success grossing ₹3.8 billion (US$64.85 million) worldwide.[174][175][176]\\n2015–2022: Career setbacks and hiatus\\nKhan next appeared alongside Kajol, Varun Dhawan and Kriti Sanon in Rohit Shetty\\'s action comedy Dilwale (2015). The film garnered mixed reviews, though it was financially profitable with a gross of ₹3.7 billion (US$57.68 million).[177] Namrata Joshi of The Hindu commented, \"With Dilwale, Rohit Shetty goes hopelessly wrong despite much that he had at his disposal, including a power-packed cast and producer\", and felt that the attempt to repackage Khan and Kajol had backfired.[178] He then took on dual parts of a superstar and his doppelgänger fan in Maneesh Sharma\\'s action thriller Fan (2016). Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian considered the film to be \"exhausting, bizarre yet watchable\" and thought that Khan was aptly \"creepy\" as the obsessive admirer.[179] The film underperformed at the box office, and trade journalists attributed this failure to the film\\'s non-conformity to mainstream formula.[180] Later that year, Khan portrayed the supporting part of a therapist to an aspiring cinematographer (Alia Bhatt) in Gauri Shinde\\'s coming-of-age film Dear Zindagi.[181]\\nIn Rahul Dholakia\\'s action crime film Raees (2017), Khan took on the part of the titular anti-hero—a bootlegger turned mobster in 1980s Gujarat. In a typical mixed review, Pratim D. Gupta of The Telegraph thought Khan\\'s performance to be \"inconsistent, intense and power-packed at times, but often slipping out of character into his usual mix of stock mannerisms\".[182] Commercially, the film was a modest success, earning about ₹3.08 billion (US$47.3 million) worldwide.[183][184] Khan returned to the romantic genre with the role of a tourist guide who falls in love with a traveller (Anushka Sharma) in Imtiaz Ali\\'s Jab Harry Met Sejal (2017). In a review for Mint, Uday Bhatia criticised Khan\\'s pairing with Sharma, 22 years his junior, writing that Khan had performed \"similar gestures of love decades ago to actors his own age\".[185] He reunited with Sharma and Katrina Kaif in Aanand L Rai\\'s romantic drama Zero (2018), in which he played Bauua Singh, a dwarf involved in a love triangle.[186][187] The film received mixed reviews with praise directed to Khan\\'s performance.[188][189] Writing for Hindustan Times, Raja Sen commended his \"dominating performance and tremendous energy\" and Anna M. M. Vetticad of Firstpost called him an \"excellent fit\" for the role for allowing his \"naturally energetic personality, comic timing and charm to take flight\".[190][191] Both Jab Harry Met Sejal and Zero were box office flops.[192][193]\\nAccording to a Box Office India report, Khan\\'s stardom was impacted by his films failing to do well.[194] Following the release of Zero, Khan took a four-year break from full-time acting, which was partly caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in India. He took the time off to attempt a career comeback.[195] During this period, he made extended special appearances in the 2022 films Brahmāstra: Part One – Shiva and Rocketry: The Nambi Effect.[196]\\n2023–present: Resurgence\\nIn 2023, Khan reunited with Yash Raj Films in the action thriller Pathaan (2023), set in the YRF Spy Universe, in which he played an exiled field agent assigned to stop a terrorist attack in India.[197] Critic Sukanya Verma took note of Khan\\'s \"weathered intensity, grizzly charisma and trademark wit\", while Kaveree Bamzai termed it a \"much-needed makeover\" of an ageing Khan into an action star.[198][199] Pathaan broke several box-office records, thus re-establishing Khan\\'s stardom.[200][201] Khan took on another action film role in the same year in Atlee\\'s Jawan, playing father and son doppelgängers.[202] Nandini Ramnath of Scroll.in wrote that \"Khan\\'s screen image – expansive, suffused with love, heroic in an old-fashioned way without being aggressively macho, irreverent but also sincere – helps sell a conceit that might have crashed with any other actor\".[203] Jawan broke the records set by Pathaan.[204] Both films grossed over ₹10 billion (US$130\\xa0million) to rank, respectively, as Hindi cinema\\'s second and third biggest grossers worldwide,[205] making Khan the first Indian actor to deliver two films that earned over ₹10 billion.[206]\\nIn his final release of 2023, Khan starred in Rajkumar Hirani\\'s Dunki, a social drama about an illegal immigration technique named donkey flight.[207][208] Uday Bhatia wrote that his role as a \"romantic feminist soldier patriot friend\" marked \"a break from Khan the action star but offers no respite from the Khan the perfect screen idol\".[209] Grossing over ₹4 billion (US$50\\xa0million), Dunki emerged as Khan\\'s third consecutive commercial success of the year, although it did not match up to the record grosses of Pathaan or Jawan.[210][211]\\nOther work\\nFilm production and television hosting\\nKhan co-produced three films from 1999 to 2003 as a founding member of the partnership Dreamz Unlimited.[86] After the partnership was dissolved, he and Gauri restructured the company as Red Chillies Entertainment,[113] which includes divisions dealing with film and television production, visual effects, and advertising.[212] As of 2015, the company has produced or co-produced at least nine films.[213] Either Khan or Gauri are usually given production credits, and he has appeared in most of the films, either in the lead role, or in a guest appearance. Khan was involved in several aspects of the making of Ra.One (2011). Aside from acting, he produced the film, volunteered to write the console game script, dubbed for it, oversaw its technical development, and wrote the digital comics based on the film\\'s characters.[214][215] Khan has occasionally done playback singing for his films. In Josh (2000) he sang the popular song \"Apun Bola Tu Meri Laila\". He also sang in Don (2006) and Jab Tak Hai Jaan (2012).[216] For Always Kabhi Kabhi (2011), which was produced by Red Chillies, Khan participated in the lyrical composition.[217]\\nIn addition to his early television serial appearances, Khan has hosted numerous televised awards shows, including the Filmfare, Zee Cine, and Screen Awards.[218][219][220] In 2007, he replaced Amitabh Bachchan for one season as the host of Kaun Banega Crorepati, the Indian version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?,[221] and a year later, Khan began hosting Kya Aap Paanchvi Pass Se Tez Hain?, the Indian version of Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?.[222] In 2011, he returned to television, appearing on Imagine TV\\'s Zor Ka Jhatka: Total Wipeout, the Indian version of Wipeout; scenes featuring Khan were shot at the Yash Raj Studios in Mumbai.[223] Contrary to his earlier television anchoring jobs, Zor Ka Jhatka: Total Wipeout performed poorly. It aired for only one season and became the lowest rated show hosted by a Bollywood star.[223] In 2017, Khan began hosting TED Talks India Nayi Soch, a talk show produced by TED Conferences, LLC which started aired on STAR Plus.[224]\\nStage performances\\nKhan is a frequent stage performer and has participated in several world tours and concerts. In 1997, he performed in Asha Bhosle\\'s Moments in Time concert in Malaysia, and returned the following year to perform with Karisma Kapoor for the Shahrukh–Karisma: Live in Malaysia concert.[225] The same year, he participated in The Awesome Foursome world tour across the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States along with Juhi Chawla, Akshay Kumar and Kajol, and resumed the tour in Malaysia the following year.[226][227] In 2002, Khan featured with Amitabh Bachchan, Aamir Khan, Preity Zinta, and Aishwarya Rai in the show From India With Love at Manchester\\'s Old Trafford and London\\'s Hyde Park; the event was attended by more than 100,000\\xa0people.[228] Khan performed alongside Rani Mukherji, Arjun Rampal and Ishaa Koppikar in a 2010 concert at the St. Joseph High School field in Dhaka, Bangladesh.[229] The next year he joined Shahid Kapoor and Priyanka Chopra in the Friendship Concert, celebrating 150\\xa0years of India–South Africa friendship in Durban, South Africa.[230]\\nKhan started an association with the \"Temptations\" series of concert tours by singing, dancing, and performing skits alongside Arjun Rampal, Priyanka Chopra, and other Bollywood stars in Temptations 2004, a stage show that toured 22\\xa0venues across the world.[231] The show played to 15,000\\xa0spectators at Dubai\\'s Festival City Arena.[232] In 2008, Khan set up Temptation Reloaded, a series of concerts that toured several countries, including the Netherlands.[233] Another tour was held with Bipasha Basu and others in 2012 in Jakarta,[234] and in 2013 another series of concerts visited Auckland, Perth and Sydney.[235] In 2014, Khan performed in SLAM! The Tour in the US, Canada, and London,[236] and also hosted the Indian premiere of the live talent show, Got Talent World Stage Live.[237]\\nOwnership of Kolkata Knight Riders\\nIn 2008, Khan, in partnership with Juhi Chawla and her husband Jay Mehta, acquired ownership rights for the franchise representing Kolkata in the Twenty20 cricket tournament Indian Premier League (IPL) for US$75.09\\xa0million, and named the team Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR).[238] As of 2009[update], KKR was one of the richest teams in the IPL, with a brand value of US$42.1\\xa0million.[239] The team performed poorly on the field during the first three years.[240] Their performance improved over time, and they became the champions for the first time in 2012[240] and repeated the feat in 2014.[241] The Knight Riders hold the record for the longest winning streak by any Indian team in T20s (14).[242]\\nKhan performed alongside Sunidhi Chauhan and Shriya Saran at the opening ceremony of the IPL 2011 season, where they danced to Tamil songs.[243] He appeared again in 2013 alongside Katrina Kaif, Deepika Padukone and Pitbull.[244] In May 2012, the Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) banned him from the Wankhede Stadium for five years for getting into an argument with the security staff after a match between KKR and the Mumbai Indians.[245] Khan had, however, stated that he acted only after children, including his daughter, were being \"manhandled\" by the security staff[245][246] and that the officials were extremely high-handed and aggressive in their behaviour,[247] he had been abused with communal indecent comment.[246] Later MCA officials had accused him of being drunk in one version of the story, hitting the guard and of completely uncharacteristically abusing a female supporter of Mumbai Indians after the match in another version of the story, which Khan had maintained it was done to support their action and for cheap publicity.[246][248][249] Wankhede guard later contradicted MCA officials\\' claim and said Shah Rukh Khan had not hit him.[246] Khan later apologised to his fans after his team won the final match.[250] MCA revoked the ban in 2015[251] and in 2016, Mumbai Police informed that no \\'cognisable offence\\' was made out against Khan and they had come to the conclusion that Shah Rukh Khan was not drunk and did not use abusive language before minors at the Wankhede Stadium in 2012.[248][249]\\nIn the media\\nKhan receives a considerable amount of media coverage in India, and is often referred to as \"King Khan\", \"The Baadshah of Bollywood\", or \"The King of Bollywood\".[a] Anupama Chopra cites him as an \"ever present celebrity\", with two or three films a year, constantly running television ads, print ads, and gigantic billboards lining the streets of Indian cities.[257] He is the object of a sometimes fanatical following, with a fan base estimated to exceed one billion.[258] Newsweek named Khan as one of their fifty most powerful people globally in 2008 and called him \"the world\\'s biggest movie star\".[259][260] In 2011 he was described as \"the biggest movie star you\\'ve never heard of...perhaps the world\\'s biggest movie star, period\" by Steven Zeitchik of the Los Angeles Times[f][262] and has been called the world\\'s biggest movie star in other international media outlets.[b] According to a popularity survey, 3.2\\xa0billion people around the world know Khan, more than who know Tom Cruise.[266] In a 2022 readers\\' poll by Empire magazine, Khan was listed as one of the 50 greatest actors of all time. The magazine attributed his success to the \"outrageous amounts of [his] charisma and absolute mastery of [his] craft.

He has regularly featured among the top ten on The Times of India\\'s list of the 50 most desirable men in India,[277][278] and in a 2007 poll by the magazine Eastern Eye he was named the sexiest man in Asia.[279] Khan is often referred to as \"Brand SRK\" by media organisations because of his many brand endorsement and entrepreneurship ventures.[280][281] He is one of the highest paid Bollywood endorsers and one of the most visible celebrities in television advertising, with up to a six per cent share of the television advertisement market.[282][283] Khan has endorsed brands including Pepsi, Nokia, Hyundai, Dish TV, D\\'decor, LUX and TAG Heuer.[283][284] Books have been published about him,[285][286] and his popularity has been documented in several non-fiction films, including the two-part documentary The Inner and Outer World of Shah Rukh Khan (2005),[287] and the Discovery Travel & Living channel\\'s ten-part miniseries Living with a Superstar—Shah Rukh Khan (2010).[282] In 2007, Khan became the third Indian actor to have his wax statue installed at London\\'s Madame Tussauds museum, after Aishwarya Rai and Amitabh Bachchan.[288][289] Additional versions of the statue were installed at Madame Tussauds\\' museums in Los Angeles, Hong Kong, New York and Washington.[290]\\nKhan has been brand ambassador of various governmental campaigns, including Pulse Polio and the National AIDS Control Organisation.[284] He is a member of the board of directors of the Make-A-Wish Foundation in India,[291] and in 2011 he was appointed by UNOPS as the first global ambassador of the Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council.[292] He has recorded a series of public service announcements championing good health and proper nutrition, and joined India\\'s Health Ministry and UNICEF in a nationwide child immunisation campaign.[293] In 2011, he received UNESCO\\'s Pyramide con Marni award for his charitable commitment to provide education for children, becoming the first Indian to win the accolade.[294] In 2014, Khan became the ambassador for Interpol\\'s campaign \"Turn Back Crime\".[295] In 2015, Khan received a privileged degree from the University of Edinburgh, Scotland.[296] In 2018, Khan was honoured by the World Economic Forum with their annual Crystal Award for his leadership in championing children\\'s and women\\'s rights in India.[297][298]\\nIn October 2019, Khan featured in a video launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to pay tribute to Mahatma Gandhi on his 150th birth anniversary.

This year, he\\'s returned to the screen transformed - a rugged, action star.\\nIn a scene from his latest film Jawan, a bald-headed, menacing Khan is seen surrounded by terrified passengers as he holds a metro train hostage. He soon bursts into song and dance, much to the confusion of his captives.\\nThe film\\'s trailer had warned audiences: \"When I become a villain, no hero stands a chance.\"\\nKhan, a household name in India, is also one of the country\\'s most popular stars with millions of fans domestically and abroad.\\nHis return to movies after a hiatus is Bollywood\\'s biggest success story this year. In place of the tender romance hero is \"a lean, mean, fighting machine\", as film critic Anupama Chopra calls him.\\nKhan has forayed into action before with films like Don (2006) and Raees (2017) but these rarely emphasised the larger-than-life persona his latest hits Pathaan and Jawan have.\\nMs Chopra says it signals a \"new phase in his career\".\\nKhan began 2023 with the spy film Pathaan in which he was seen racing against time to save the country from a terror attack. The film broke domestic box office records to cross $120m (£98m) in four weeks. His latest film Jawan - showcasing the actor in a double role and multiple avatars - surpassed the record last month in 18 days.\\n\"The persona we\\'re seeing on screen now is very different from what we\\'ve seen in earlier films,\" Ms Chopra says.\\nKhan\\'s initial success in films came in anti-hero roles - a stalker in Darr (1993), an obsessive lover in Baazigar (1993), a vengeful antagonist in Anjaam (1994). But the 1995 blockbuster Dilwali Dulhania Le Jayenge firmly established him as a romantic hero.\\nSince then, he\\'s acted in a host of dramas and comedies but remains the king of romance. His signature pose - arms spread out wide as he mouths the words to a romantic ballad - has defined many of his characters.\\nJawan and Pathaan keep the wit and charisma of this persona but feature Khan as a muscled superstar performing gravity-defying stunts.\\nCritic Rahul Desai says the two films have revived his career and stardom.\\nThey manage a tough balancing act every director working with Khan must face, Ms Chopra says - \"fan service, bolstering the myth [of the star] while giving something new to the audience\".\\nKhan\\'s four-year absence from films came after a series of setbacks in his personal and professional life. In 2016 and 2017, his films opened to middling reviews and lacklustre box office. Since 2018, his appearances have remained confined to cameos and voiceovers. In 2021, his son Aryan Khan\\'s arrest over drug possession became national news. The fake charges were eventually dropped.\\nPathaan and Jawan channel Khan\\'s personal and professional frustrations in the \"most obvious and visual way possible\", Mr Desai says.\\nThe two films have different styles yet their message is similar - a patriotic hero surrounded by allies of diverse religious and regional backgrounds who work together to save a country in crisis.\\nThe theme stands in stark contrast to a category of recent Bollywood films - like Kerala Story (2022) and Kashmir Files (2021) - that have received praise from Prime Minister Narendra Modi and leaders of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). These films claim some connection with either Hindu religious beliefs or nationalism. Though unpopular with some critics, they have been hits.\\nIn Jawan, Khan plays the son of an army officer (also played by Khan) fighting to clear his father\\'s name of trumped-up charges. He wears multiple hats as he takes on a corrupt political system to bring justice denied to the common man.\\nKhan\\'s films have often merged fiction and life, Mr Desai says, \"Our enjoyment is derived from the illusion that we\\'re watching him as much as the men he plays,\" he wrote in his review of Jawan.\\n\"Earlier, these movies were self-reverential, celebratory in terms of his superstar legacy,\" Mr Desai tells the BBC. \"The difference now is that films like Pathaan and Jawan fictionalise his identity and opinions as a person (celebrity, father, lover, patriot), and his relationship with the country/establishment in the current climate.\"\\nThe subtext is not entirely new to his films - critics say a lot of his older films also had political undertones.\\n\"A film like Swades (in which he plays a Nasa engineer who returns to live in India) was talking about a certain kind of patriotism,\" Ms Chopra says. \"But what\\'s happened in the last few years in India and in his life has led to much deeper reading of political undertones.\"\\nSince Mr Modi\\'s nationalist government came to power, activists say the frequency of hate crimes against Muslims and other minorities has increased. The BJP denies the accusations, but its leaders rarely condemn such incidents.\\n\"This year\\'s blockbusters have understood and designed Khan\\'s comeback not just as an actor but as a Muslim superstar in a country governed by a Hindu-majoritarian party,\" Mr Desai says.\\n\"A lot of the viewers don\\'t realise that they\\'re actually rooting for the tolerance and old-school secularism he represents when they watch these movies,\" he adds.\\nA scene from Jawan referenced by critics and audiences alike is Khan\\'s monologue on the importance of voting and political accountability.\\nSeveral political parties, including the ruling BJP and the opposition Congress, claimed it referred to the other.\\nMs Chopra says its a good sign \"when you do something that has impact across the board\".\\nKhan\\'s success with these films \"has propelled him back into a space where he\\'s not just a nostalgic idea anymore\", Mr Desai says.\\nBut Shrayana Bhattacharya, author of the book Desperately Seeking Shah Rukh, says Khan has always been too loved to need a \"revival\".\\nMs Bhattacharya spent 15 years interviewing the superstar\\'s fans for her book. \"No-one ever reduced him to the banal binaries of identity politics,\" she says.\\nExcited fans have mobilised to see their favourite actor after a hiatus, Ms Bhattacharya says. \"They wanted to express solidarity and enjoy themselves. Fun is subversive in its own ways.\"\\nKhan still has a lot to offer as an actor, Mr Desai says. \"I look forward to him ageing, getting more secure with his stardom, going beyond making statements and choosing more diverse roles.\"\\nBBC News India is now on YouTube.

Referred to in the media as the \"Baadshah of Bollywood\" and \"King Khan\",[a] he has appeared in more than 100 films, and earned numerous accolades, including 14 Filmfare Awards. He has been awarded the Padma Shri by the Government of India, as well as the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and Legion of Honour by the Government of France. Khan has a significant following in Asia and the Indian diaspora worldwide. In terms of audience size and income, several media outlets have described him as one of the most successful film stars in the world.[b] Many of his films thematise Indian national identity and connections with diaspora communities, or gender, racial, social and religious differences and grievances.\\nKhan began his career with appearances in several television series in the late 1980s and made his Bollywood debut in 1992 with the musical romance Deewana. He was initially recognised for playing villainous roles in the films Baazigar (1993) and Darr (1993). Khan established himself by starring in a series of top-grossing romantic films, including Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (1995), Dil To Pagal Hai (1997), Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998), Mohabbatein (2000), Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... (2001), Kal Ho Naa Ho (2003), Veer-Zaara (2004) and Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna (2006). He earned critical acclaim for his portrayal of an alcoholic in the period romantic drama Devdas (2002), a NASA scientist in the social drama Swades (2004), a hockey coach in the sports drama Chak De! India (2007), and a man with Asperger syndrome in the drama My Name Is Khan (2010). Further commercial successes came with the romances Om Shanti Om (2007) and Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi (2008), and with his expansion to comedies in Chennai Express (2013) and Happy New Year (2014). Following a brief setback and hiatus, Khan made a career comeback with the 2023 action thrillers Pathaan and Jawan, both of which rank among the highest-grossing Indian films.\\nAs of 2015, Khan is co-chairman of the motion picture production company Red Chillies Entertainment and its subsidiaries and is the co-owner of the Indian Premier League cricket team Kolkata Knight Riders and the Caribbean Premier League team Trinbago Knight Riders. The media often label him as \"Brand SRK\" because of his many endorsements and entrepreneurship ventures. He is a frequent television presenter and stage show performer. Khan\\'s philanthropic endeavours have provided health care and disaster relief, and he was honoured with UNESCO\\'s Pyramide con Marni award in 2011 for his support of children\\'s education and the World Economic Forum\\'s Crystal Award in 2018 for advocating for women\\'s and children\\'s rights in India. He regularly features in listings of the most influential people in Indian culture, and in 2008, Newsweek named him one of their fifty most powerful people in the world. In 2022, Khan was voted one of the 50 greatest actors of all time in a readers\\' poll by Empire, and in 2023, Time named him as one of the most influential people in the world.\\nEarly life and family\\nParents\\nKhan\\'s father, Mir Taj Mohammed Khan, was an Indian independence activist from Peshawar who campaigned alongside the Khudai Khidmatgar, a nonviolent resistance movement led by Abdul Ghaffar Khan that sought a united and independent India.[1][2] Mir was a follower of Abdul Ghaffar Khan,[3] and affiliated with the Indian National Congress.[4] He was also the cousin of the major general in the Indian National Army Shah Nawaz Khan.[c]\\nAccording to Khan his paternal grandfather, Mir Jan Muhammad Khan, was an ethnic Pashtun (Pathan) from Afghanistan.[7][4][8] However, his paternal cousins in Peshawar later clarified that the family speaks Hindko and is originally from Kashmir, from where they settled in Peshawar centuries back, contradicting the claim that his grandfather was a Pashtun from Afghanistan.[4][9] As of 2010, Khan\\'s paternal family was still living in the Shah Wali Qataal area of Peshawar\\'s Qissa Khwani Bazaar.[4]\\nIn 1946, Mir moved to Delhi to study law at Delhi University.[10] When the partition of India occurred in 1947, he was forced to stay in Delhi, and did not return to Peshawar until many years later.[11] Khan\\'s mother, Lateef Fatima, a magistrate, was the daughter of a senior government engineer.[12][c][13] His parents were married in 1959.[14]\\nEarly life\\nKhan was born on 2 November 1965 into a Muslim family in New Delhi.[15] He spent the first five years of his life in Mangalore, where his maternal grandfather, Iftikhar Ahmed, served as chief engineer of the port in the 1960s.[16][17][d] Khan has described himself on Twitter as \"half Hyderabadi (mother), half Pathan (father), and some Kashmiri (grandmother)\".[19]\\nKhan grew up in the Rajendra Nagar neighbourhood of New Delhi.[20] His father had several business ventures including a restaurant, and the family lived a middle-class life in rented apartments.[21] Khan attended St. Columba\\'s School in central Delhi where he excelled in his studies and in sports such as hockey and football,[22] and received the school\\'s highest award, the Sword of Honour.[21] Initially Khan aspired to pursue a career in sports, however owing to a shoulder injury in his early years meant that he could no longer play.[23] Instead, in his youth, he acted in stage plays and received praise for his imitations of Bollywood actors, of which his favourites were Dilip Kumar, Amitabh Bachchan, and Mumtaz.[24] One of his childhood friends and acting partners was Amrita Singh, who became a Bollywood actress.[25] Khan enrolled at Hansraj College (1985–88) to earn his bachelor\\'s degree in economics, but spent much of his time at Delhi\\'s Theatre Action Group (TAG),[26] where he studied acting under the mentorship of theatre director Barry John.[27][28] After Hansraj, he began studying for a master\\'s degree in mass communication at Jamia Millia Islamia, but left to pursue his acting career.[29] He also attended the National School of Drama in Delhi during his early career in Bollywood.[30]\\nHis father died of cancer in 1981,[e] and his mother died in 1991 from complications of diabetes.[33] After the death of their parents, his older sister, Shahnaz Lalarukh (born 1960)[34] fell into a depressed state and Khan took on the responsibility of caring for her.[31][35] Shahnaz continues to live with her brother and his family in their Mumbai mansion.[36]\\nActing career\\n1988–1992: Television and film debut\\nKhan\\'s first starring role was in Lekh Tandon\\'s television series Dil Dariya, which began shooting in 1988, but production delays led to the Raj Kumar Kapoor directed 1989 series Fauji becoming his television debut instead.[37] In the series, which depicted a realistic look at the training of army cadets, he played the leading role of Abhimanyu Rai.[38][39] This led to further appearances in Aziz Mirza\\'s television series Circus (1989–90) and Mani Kaul\\'s miniseries Idiot (1992).[40] Khan also played minor parts in the serials Umeed (1989) and Wagle Ki Duniya (1988–90),[40] and in the English-language television film In Which Annie Gives It Those Ones (1989).[41] His appearances in these serials led critics to compare his look and acting style with those of the film actor Dilip Kumar,[42] but Khan was not interested in film acting at the time, thinking that he was not good enough.[40][43]\\nKhan changed his decision to act in films in April 1991,[44] citing it as a way to escape the grief of his mother\\'s death.[45] He moved from Delhi to Mumbai to pursue a full-time career in Bollywood and was quickly signed to four films.[44] His first offer was for Hema Malini\\'s directorial debut Dil Aashna Hai,[30][38] and by June, he had started his first shoot.[46] His film debut was in Deewana, which was released in June 1992.[47] In it he starred alongside Divya Bharti as the second male lead behind Rishi Kapoor. Deewana became a box office hit and launched Khan\\'s Bollywood career;[48] he earned the Filmfare Best Male Debut Award for his performance.[49] Also released in 1992 were Khan\\'s first films as the male lead, Chamatkar, Dil Aashna Hai, and the comedy Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman, which was his first of many collaborations with the actress Juhi Chawla.[50] His initial film roles saw him play characters who displayed energy and enthusiasm. According to Arnab Ray of Daily News and Analysis, Khan brought a new kind of acting as he was \"sliding down stairs on a slab of ice, cartwheeling, somersaulting, lips trembling, eyes trembling, bringing to the screen the kind of physical energy\\xa0... visceral, intense, maniacal one moment and cloyingly boyish the next.\"[51]\\n1993–1994: Anti-hero\\nAmong his 1993 releases, Khan garnered the most appreciation for portraying villainous roles in two box office hits: a murderer in Baazigar, and an obsessive lover in Darr.[52] The former, in which Khan played an ambiguous avenger who murders his girlfriend, shocked Indian audiences with an unexpected violation of the standard Bollywood formula.[53] In The Cambridge Companion to Modern Indian Culture, Sonal Khullar called the character \"the consummate anti-hero\".[54] His performance in Baazigar, which would be his first of many appearances with actress Kajol, won Khan his first Filmfare Award for Best Actor.[55] In 2003, the Encyclopaedia of Hindi Cinema stated that Khan \"defied the image of the conventional hero in both these films and created his own version of the revisionist hero\".[55] Darr marked the first of Khan\\'s many collaborations with filmmaker Yash Chopra and his company Yash Raj Films. Khan\\'s stammering and the use of the phrase \"I love you, K-k-k-Kiran\" were popular with audiences.[56] Malini Mannath of The Indian Express argued that he \"walks away with the acting honours in yet another negative role\".[57] For Darr he received a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Performance in a Negative Role, also known as the Best Villain Award, but lost to Paresh Rawal for Sir.[58] Also in 1993, Khan performed a nude scene with Deepa Sahi in Maya Memsaab, although parts of it were censored by the Central Board of Film Certification.[59] The ensuing controversy prompted him to eschew such scenes in future roles.[60]\\nIn 1994, Khan played a love-struck musician in Kundan Shah\\'s comedy-drama film Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa opposite Deepak Tijori and Suchitra Krishnamurthy, which he later professed was his favourite role. His performance earned him a Filmfare Critics Award for Best Performance, and in a retrospective review from 2004, Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com referred to it as Khan\\'s best performance, calling him \"spontaneous, vulnerable, boyish, mischievous and acting straight from the heart\".[61] Also in 1994, Khan won the Filmfare Best Villain Award for his role as an obsessive lover in Anjaam, co-starring Madhuri Dixit.[55] At the time, playing antagonistic roles was considered risky to a leading man\\'s career in mainstream Hindi cinema. Arnab Ray subsequently credited Khan for taking \"insane risks\" and \"pushing the envelope\" by choosing to play such characters, through which he established his career.[51] The director Mukul S. Anand called him \"the new face of the industry\" at the time.[45]\\n1995–1998: Romantic roles\\nKhan starred in seven films in 1995, the first of which was Rakesh Roshan\\'s melodramatic thriller Karan Arjun. Co-starring Salman Khan and Kajol, it became the second-highest-grossing film of the year in India.[62] His most significant release that year was Aditya Chopra\\'s directorial debut, the romance Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, in which he played a young Non-resident Indian (NRI) who falls in love with Kajol\\'s character during a trip across Europe. Khan was initially reticent to portray the role of a lover, but this film is credited with establishing him as a \"romantic hero\".[63] Lauded by both critics and the public, it became the year\\'s highest grossing production in India and abroad and was declared an \"all time blockbuster\" by Box Office India,[62][64] with an estimated lifetime gross of ₹2 billion (US$61.68 million) worldwide.[65][66] It is the longest-running film in the history of Indian cinema; it is still showing at the Maratha Mandir theatre in Mumbai after more than 1000 weeks as of early 2015.[67][68] The film won ten Filmfare Awards, including the second of Khan\\'s Best Actor Awards.[55] The director and critic Raja Sen said, \"Khan gives a fabulous performance, redefining the lover for the 1990s with great panache. He\\'s cool and flippant, but sincere enough to appeal to the [audience]. The performance itself is, like the best in the business, played well enough to come across as effortless, as non-acting.\"[69]\\nIn 1996, all four of Khan\\'s releases failed critically and commercially,[70] but the following year, his starring role opposite Aditya Pancholi and Juhi Chawla in Aziz Mirza\\'s romantic comedy Yes Boss earned him accolades that included a Filmfare Best Actor nomination.[58] Later in 1997, he starred in Subhash Ghai\\'s diasporic-themed social drama Pardes,[71] portraying Arjun, a musician facing a moral dilemma. India Today cites it as one of the first major Bollywood pictures to succeed in the United States.[72] Khan\\'s final release of 1997 was the second collaboration with Yash Chopra in the popular musical romance Dil To Pagal Hai. He portrayed Rahul, a stage director caught in a love triangle between Madhuri Dixit and Karisma Kapoor. The film and his performance met with critical praise, winning Khan his third Best Actor Award at Filmfare.[55]\\nKhan performed the lead role in three films and made one special appearance in 1998. In his first release of the year, he played a double role opposite Juhi Chawla and Sonali Bendre in Mahesh Bhatt\\'s action comedy Duplicate, the first of his many collaborations with Yash Johar\\'s production company Dharma Productions. The film was not well received,[73] but India Today lauded Khan for his energetic performance.[74] The same year, Khan won critical praise for his performance as an All India Radio correspondent who develops an infatuation for a mysterious terrorist (Manisha Koirala) in Dil Se..,[75] the third instalment of Mani Ratnam\\'s trilogy of terror films.[76][77] In his final release of the year, he portrayed a college student in Karan Johar\\'s romance Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, in which he was involved in a love triangle along with Kajol and Rani Mukerji. The writer Anjana Motihar Chandra has referred to the picture as the blockbuster of the 1990s, a \"pot-pourri of romance, comedy, and entertainment.\"[78] Khan won the Best Actor award at the Filmfare Awards ceremony for the second consecutive year,[55] although he and several critics believed his performance to have been overshadowed by that of Kajol.[79]\\nThe roles in this phase of his career, and the series of romantic comedies and family dramas that followed, earned Khan widespread adulation from audiences, particularly teenagers,[80] and according to the author Anupama Chopra, established him as an icon of romance in India.[81][82] He continued to have frequent professional associations with Yash Chopra, Aditya Chopra, and Karan Johar, who moulded his image and made him into a superstar.[83] Khan became a romantic leading man without ever actually kissing any of his co-stars,[81] although he broke this rule in 2012, after strong urging by Yash Chopra.[84]\\n1999–2003: Career fluctuations\\nKhan\\'s only release in 1999 was Baadshah, in which he starred opposite Twinkle Khanna. Although the film underperformed at the box office,[85] it earned him a Filmfare Award nomination for Best Performance in a Comic Role, which he lost to Govinda for Haseena Maan Jaayegi.[58] Khan became a producer in 1999 in a collaboration with the actress Juhi Chawla and the director Aziz Mirza for a production company called Dreamz Unlimited.[86] The company\\'s first production, Phir Bhi Dil Hai Hindustani (2000), starring Khan and Chawla, was a commercial failure.[87] It was released one week after Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai, starring Hrithik Roshan, then a newcomer, who critics believed overshadowed Khan.[88] Swapna Mitter of Rediff.com spoke of Khan\\'s predictable mannerisms, saying \"Frankly, it\\'s high time he innovated his act a little.\"[89] Khan did a supporting role in Kamal Haasan\\'s Hey Ram (2000), which was made simultaneously in Tamil and Hindi. He thereby made his Tamil debut by playing the role of an archaeologist named Amjad Khan.[90] He performed free of charge as he wanted to work with Haasan.[91][92] On Khan\\'s performance, T. Krithika Reddy of The Hindu wrote, \"Shah Rukh Khan, as usual comes up with an impeccable performance.\"[90]\\nIn 2001, Dreamz Unlimited attempted a comeback with Khan portraying the title role in Santosh Sivan\\'s historical epic Aśoka, a partly fictionalised account of the life of emperor Ashoka. The film was screened at the Venice Film Festival and the 2001 Toronto International Film Festival to a positive response,[93] but it performed poorly at Indian box offices.[94] As losses continued to mount for the production company,[88] Khan was forced to close srkworld.com, a company that he had started along with Dreamz Unlimited.[95] In December 2001, Khan suffered a spinal injury while performing an action sequence for a special appearance in Krishna Vamsi\\'s Shakti: The Power.[96] He was subsequently diagnosed with a prolapsed disc, and attempted multiple alternative therapies. None of these provided a permanent solution to the injury, which caused him severe pain while shooting several of his films.[96][97] By the beginning of 2003, his condition had worsened to the point that he had to undergo anterior cervical discectomy and fusion surgery at Wellington Hospital, London.[98][99][100] Khan resumed shooting in June 2003, but he reduced his workload and the number of film roles he accepted annually.[97]\\nSuccesses during this time included Aditya Chopra\\'s Mohabbatein (2000), and Karan Johar\\'s family drama Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... (2001),[87][101] which Khan cites as a turning point in his career.[102] Both films co-starred Amitabh Bachchan as an authoritarian figure, and presented ideological struggles between the two men.[103][104] Khan\\'s performances in the films were met with wide public appreciation, and he was awarded his second Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor for Mohabbatein.[58][105] Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... remained the top-grossing Indian production of all time in the overseas market for the next five years.[106]\\nIn 2002, Khan played the title role as a rebellious alcoholic opposite Aishwarya Rai and Madhuri Dixit in Sanjay Leela Bhansali\\'s period romance Devdas. At a cost of over ₹500 million (US$10.29 million), it was the most expensive Bollywood film ever made at the time,[107] and became a box office success, earning approximately ₹1.68 billion ($35\\xa0million) worldwide.[108] The film earned numerous accolades including 10 Filmfare Awards, with Best Actor for Khan,[49] and a BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language.[109] Khan next starred in Kal Ho Naa Ho (2003), a comedy-drama written by Karan Johar and set in New York City, which became the second-highest-grossing film domestically and the top-grossing Bollywood film in external markets that year.[101][110] Co-starring with Jaya Bachchan, Saif Ali Khan, and Preity Zinta, Khan received critical praise for his portrayal of Aman Mathur, a man with a fatal heart disease, with critics praising his emotional impact upon audiences.[111] Conflict broke out between Khan and the other partners of Dreamz Unlimited over the failure to cast Juhi Chawla in their 2003 production of Aziz Mirza\\'s Chalte Chalte, and they parted ways, despite the film\\'s success.[112]\\n2004–2009: Comeback\\n2004 was a critically and commercially successful year for Khan. He transformed Dreamz Unlimited into Red Chillies Entertainment, adding his wife Gauri as a producer.[113] In the company\\'s first production, he starred in Farah Khan\\'s directorial debut, the masala film Main Hoon Na. A fictionalised account of India–Pakistan relations, it was viewed by some commentators as a conscious effort to move away from the stereotypical portrayal of Pakistan as the constant villain.[114] Khan then played an Indian Air Force pilot who falls in love with a Pakistani woman (Preity Zinta) in Yash Chopra\\'s romance film Veer-Zaara, which was screened at the 55th Berlin Film Festival to critical praise.[115] It was the highest earning film of 2004 in India, with a worldwide gross of over ₹940 million (US$20.74 million), and Main Hoon Na was the second-highest earner with ₹680 million (US$15.01 million).[106][116]\\nIn his final release of 2004, Khan starred as a NASA scientist who patriotically returns to India to rekindle his roots in Ashutosh Gowariker\\'s social drama Swades (meaning \"Homeland\"), which became the first Indian picture to be shot inside the NASA research centre at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.[117] Film scholar Stephen Teo refers to the picture as an example of \"Bollywoodised realism\", displaying a transcendence in conventional narrative and audience expectation in Hindi cinema.[118] In December 2013, The Times of India reported that Khan found filming the picture such an emotionally overwhelming and life-changing experience that he had still not viewed the film.[119] Derek Elley of Variety found Khan\\'s performance \"unsettling\" as \"a self-satisfied expatriate determined to bring Western values to poor Indian peasants\",[120] but several film critics, including Jitesh Pillai, believed it to have been his finest acting to date.[121][122] He was nominated for the Filmfare Best Actor Award for all three of his 2004 releases and eventually won the award for Swades.[49][58] Filmfare later included his performance in the 2010 issue of Bollywood\\'s \"Top 80 Iconic Performances\".[123]\\nIn 2005, Khan starred in Amol Palekar\\'s fantasy drama, Paheli. The film was India\\'s submission for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 79th Academy Awards.[124] He later collaborated with Karan Johar for the third time in the musical romantic drama Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna (2006), in which he played an unhappily married man who has an extramarital affair with a married woman. The film, which featured an ensemble cast including Amitabh Bachchan, Abhishek Bachchan, Rani Mukerji, Preity Zinta and Kirron Kher, emerged as India\\'s highest-grossing film in the overseas market,[101] earning more than ₹1.13 billion (US$25.62 million) worldwide.[106] Both his roles in Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna and the action film Don, a remake of the 1978 film of the same name, earned Khan Best Actor nominations at the Filmfare Awards,[125] despite his performance as the titular character in Don being negatively compared to that of Amitabh Bachchan in the original film.[126][127]\\n\"Such great things have happened to such a normal guy like me. I am a nobody who shouldn\\'t have been able to do all this but I have done it. I tell everyone that there\\'s this myth I work for; there is this myth called Shahrukh Khan and I am his employee. I have to live up to that\\xa0... I\\'ll do it, I am an actor. But I can\\'t start believing in this myth.\"\\n—Khan reflecting in 2007 on his position as the Hindi film industry\\'s top star[128]\\nIn 2007, Khan portrayed a disgraced hockey player who coached the Indian women\\'s national hockey team to World Cup success in Yash Raj Films\\' semi-fictional Chak De! India. Bhaichand Patel notes that Khan, who had a background in the sport playing for his university\\'s hockey team,[129] essentially portrayed himself as a \"cosmopolitan, liberal, Indian Muslim\".[130] Faring well in both India and abroad,[106][131] Khan garnered another Filmfare Award for Best Actor for his performance,[49] which Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN considers to have been \"without any of his typical trappings, without any of his trademark quirks\", portraying Kabir Khan \"like a real flesh-and-blood human being\".[132] Filmfare included his performance in their 2010 issue of the \"Top 80 Iconic Performances\".[133] In the same year, Khan starred alongside Arjun Rampal, Deepika Padukone and Shreyas Talpade in Farah Khan\\'s reincarnation melodrama Om Shanti Om, portraying a 1970s junior artiste who is reborn as a 2000s era superstar. The film became the highest grossing Indian motion picture of 2007, both domestically and abroad.[101][134] Om Shanti Om earned Khan his second nomination of the year for Best Actor at Filmfare.[135] Khalid Mohammed from Hindustan Times wrote, \"the enterprise belongs to Shah Rukh Khan, who tackles comedy, high drama and action with his signature style—spontaneous and intuitively intelligent\".[136]\\nKhan collaborated for the third time with Aditya Chopra on the romantic comedy Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi (2008) opposite Anushka Sharma, at that time a newcomer. He played Surinder Sahni, a shy man with low self-esteem, whose love for his young arranged wife (Sharma) causes him to transform himself into Raj, a boisterous alter-ego. Rachel Saltz of The New York Times believed the dual role to have been \"tailor-made\" for Khan, allowing him to display his talents,[137] although Deep Contractor from Epilogue thought Khan displayed greater strength in the role of Surinder and weakness in the role of monologue-prone Raj.[138] In December 2008, Khan suffered a shoulder injury while filming a small role in Mudassar Aziz\\'s Dulha Mil Gaya. He underwent extensive physiotherapy sessions at the time but the pain left him almost immobile and he had arthroscopic surgery in February 2009.[139][140] He performed a special appearance in the 2009 film Billu, playing Bollywood superstar Sahir Khan—a fictionalised version of himself, wherein he performed musical item numbers with actresses Kareena Kapoor, Priyanka Chopra, and Deepika Padukone.[141] As head of the film\\'s production company, Red Chillies, Khan made the call to change the title of the film from Billu Barber to Billu after hairdressers across the country complained that the word \"barber\" was derogatory. The company covered up the offending word on billboards that had already been installed with the original title.[142]\\n2010–2014: Expansion to action and comedy\\nAfter refusing the role that subsequently went to Anil Kapoor in Danny Boyle\\'s Slumdog Millionaire (2008), Khan began shooting My Name Is Khan (2010), his fourth collaboration with director Karan Johar and his sixth with Kajol.[143] The film is based on a true story and set against the backdrop of perceptions of Islam after the 11 September attacks. Khan plays Rizwan Khan, a Muslim suffering from mild Asperger syndrome who sets out on a journey across America to meet the country\\'s president, in a role that film scholar Stephen Teo sees as a \"symbol of assertive rasa values\" and another example of Khan representing NRI identity in global Bollywood.[144] To provide an accurate portrayal of a sufferer without disparagement, Khan spent several months researching his role by reading books, watching videos and talking to people affected by the condition.[145][146] Upon release, My Name is Khan became one of the highest grossing Bollywood films of all time outside India,[106][101] and earned Khan his eighth Filmfare Award for Best Actor,[49] equalling the record for the most wins in the category with actor Dilip Kumar.[147] Jay Wesissberg from Variety noted how Khan portrayed the Asperger\\'s sufferer with \"averted eyes, springy steps, [and] stuttered repetitions of memorized texts\", believing it to have been a \"standout performance sure to receive the Autism Society\\'s gold seal of approval\".[148]\\nIn 2011, Khan starred alongside Arjun Rampal and Kareena Kapoor in Anubhav Sinha\\'s superhero film Ra.One, his first work in this subgenre, as a favour to his children.[149] The film follows the story of a London-based videogame designer who creates a villainous character who escapes into the real world. It was billed as Bollywood\\'s most expensive production; it had an estimated budget of ₹1.25 billion (US$26.78 million).[150][151] Despite negative media coverage of the film\\'s box office performance, Ra.One was a financial success with a gross of ₹2.4 billion (US$51.42 million).[152][153] The film, and Khan\\'s portrayal of a dual role, received mixed reviews; while most critics praised his performance as the robotic superhero G.One, though they criticised his portrayal of the videogame designer Shekhar.[154] Khan\\'s second release of 2011 was Don 2, a sequel to Don (2006).[155] To prepare for his role, Khan exercised extensively and performed most of the stunts himself.[156] His performance earned him positive reviews from critics; Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India said, \"Shah Rukh remains in command and never loses his foothold, neither through the dramatic sequences nor through the action cuts\".[157] The year\\'s highest grossing Bollywood production abroad,[158][159] it was showcased at the 62nd Berlin International Film Festival.[160]\\nKhan\\'s only release in 2012 was Yash Chopra\\'s last picture,[161] the romantic drama Jab Tak Hai Jaan, which saw him once again in a romantic role, starring opposite Katrina Kaif and Anushka Sharma. CNN-IBN considered the overall performance by Khan to have been one of his finest to date, but believed that Khan\\'s first screen kiss of his career with Katrina Kaif, twenty years his junior, was an awkward one.[84][162] Jab Tak Hai Jaan was a moderate financial success earning over ₹2.11 billion (US$39.49 million) worldwide.[163][164] The film was showcased at the 2012 Marrakech International Film Festival in Morocco, along with Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham..., Veer-Zaara, and Don 2.[165] At the following Zee Cine Awards, Khan performed a tribute to the late Yash Chopra along with Kaif, Sharma, and several of Chopra\\'s other past heroines.[166]\\nIn 2013, Khan starred in Rohit Shetty\\'s action comedy Chennai Express for Red Chillies Entertainment, a film which earned mixed critical reviews and a fair amount of criticism for its perceived disparagement of South Indian culture, although the film included a tribute to Tamil cinema star Rajinikanth.[167] The critic Khalid Mohamed thought that Khan overacted in the film and criticised him for \"re-rendering every old trick in the acting book\".[168] Despite the criticism, the film broke many box office records for Hindi films in both India and abroad, surpassing 3 Idiots to briefly become the highest grossing Bollywood film of all time, with a gross of almost ₹4 billion (US$68.26 million) in worldwide ticket sales.[169][170] On International Women\\'s Day in 2013, The Times of India reported that Khan had requested a new convention with the name of his lead female co-stars appearing above his own in the credits. He claimed that the women in his life, including his co-stars, have been the reason for his success.[171] In 2014, the actor was featured in Farah Khan\\'s ensemble action comedy Happy New Year, which co-starred Deepika Padukone, Abhishek Bachchan and Boman Irani; his third collaboration with the director.[172] Although Khan\\'s unidimensional character was criticised,[173] the film became a major commercial success grossing ₹3.8 billion (US$64.85 million) worldwide.[174][175][176]\\n2015–2022: Career setbacks and hiatus\\nKhan next appeared alongside Kajol, Varun Dhawan and Kriti Sanon in Rohit Shetty\\'s action comedy Dilwale (2015). The film garnered mixed reviews, though it was financially profitable with a gross of ₹3.7 billion (US$57.68 million).[177] Namrata Joshi of The Hindu commented, \"With Dilwale, Rohit Shetty goes hopelessly wrong despite much that he had at his disposal, including a power-packed cast and producer\", and felt that the attempt to repackage Khan and Kajol had backfired.[178] He then took on dual parts of a superstar and his doppelgänger fan in Maneesh Sharma\\'s action thriller Fan (2016). Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian considered the film to be \"exhausting, bizarre yet watchable\" and thought that Khan was aptly \"creepy\" as the obsessive admirer.[179] The film underperformed at the box office, and trade journalists attributed this failure to the film\\'s non-conformity to mainstream formula.[180] Later that year, Khan portrayed the supporting part of a therapist to an aspiring cinematographer (Alia Bhatt) in Gauri Shinde\\'s coming-of-age film Dear Zindagi.[181]\\nIn Rahul Dholakia\\'s action crime film Raees (2017), Khan took on the part of the titular anti-hero—a bootlegger turned mobster in 1980s Gujarat. In a typical mixed review, Pratim D. Gupta of The Telegraph thought Khan\\'s performance to be \"inconsistent, intense and power-packed at times, but often slipping out of character into his usual mix of stock mannerisms\".[182] Commercially, the film was a modest success, earning about ₹3.08 billion (US$47.3 million) worldwide.[183][184] Khan returned to the romantic genre with the role of a tourist guide who falls in love with a traveller (Anushka Sharma) in Imtiaz Ali\\'s Jab Harry Met Sejal (2017). In a review for Mint, Uday Bhatia criticised Khan\\'s pairing with Sharma, 22 years his junior, writing that Khan had performed \"similar gestures of love decades ago to actors his own age\".[185] He reunited with Sharma and Katrina Kaif in Aanand L Rai\\'s romantic drama Zero (2018), in which he played Bauua Singh, a dwarf involved in a love triangle.[186][187] The film received mixed reviews with praise directed to Khan\\'s performance.[188][189] Writing for Hindustan Times, Raja Sen commended his \"dominating performance and tremendous energy\" and Anna M. M. Vetticad of Firstpost called him an \"excellent fit\" for the role for allowing his \"naturally energetic personality, comic timing and charm to take flight\".[190][191] Both Jab Harry Met Sejal and Zero were box office flops.[192][193]\\nAccording to a Box Office India report, Khan\\'s stardom was impacted by his films failing to do well.[194] Following the release of Zero, Khan took a four-year break from full-time acting, which was partly caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in India. He took the time off to attempt a career comeback.[195] During this period, he made extended special appearances in the 2022 films Brahmāstra: Part One – Shiva and Rocketry: The Nambi Effect.[196]\\n2023–present: Resurgence\\nIn 2023, Khan reunited with Yash Raj Films in the action thriller Pathaan (2023), set in the YRF Spy Universe, in which he played an exiled field agent assigned to stop a terrorist attack in India.[197] Critic Sukanya Verma took note of Khan\\'s \"weathered intensity, grizzly charisma and trademark wit\", while Kaveree Bamzai termed it a \"much-needed makeover\" of an ageing Khan into an action star.[198][199] Pathaan broke several box-office records, thus re-establishing Khan\\'s stardom.[200][201] Khan took on another action film role in the same year in Atlee\\'s Jawan, playing father and son doppelgängers.[202] Nandini Ramnath of Scroll.in wrote that \"Khan\\'s screen image – expansive, suffused with love, heroic in an old-fashioned way without being aggressively macho, irreverent but also sincere – helps sell a conceit that might have crashed with any other actor\".[203] Jawan broke the records set by Pathaan.[204] Both films grossed over ₹10 billion (US$130\\xa0million) to rank, respectively, as Hindi cinema\\'s second and third biggest grossers worldwide,[205] making Khan the first Indian actor to deliver two films that earned over ₹10 billion.[206]\\nIn his final release of 2023, Khan starred in Rajkumar Hirani\\'s Dunki, a social drama about an illegal immigration technique named donkey flight.[207][208] Uday Bhatia wrote that his role as a \"romantic feminist soldier patriot friend\" marked \"a break from Khan the action star but offers no respite from the Khan the perfect screen idol\".[209] Grossing over ₹4 billion (US$50\\xa0million), Dunki emerged as Khan\\'s third consecutive commercial success of the year, although it did not match up to the record grosses of Pathaan or Jawan.[210][211]\\nOther work\\nFilm production and television hosting\\nKhan co-produced three films from 1999 to 2003 as a founding member of the partnership Dreamz Unlimited.[86] After the partnership was dissolved, he and Gauri restructured the company as Red Chillies Entertainment,[113] which includes divisions dealing with film and television production, visual effects, and advertising.[212] As of 2015, the company has produced or co-produced at least nine films.[213] Either Khan or Gauri are usually given production credits, and he has appeared in most of the films, either in the lead role, or in a guest appearance. Khan was involved in several aspects of the making of Ra.One (2011). Aside from acting, he produced the film, volunteered to write the console game script, dubbed for it, oversaw its technical development, and wrote the digital comics based on the film\\'s characters.[214][215] Khan has occasionally done playback singing for his films. In Josh (2000) he sang the popular song \"Apun Bola Tu Meri Laila\". He also sang in Don (2006) and Jab Tak Hai Jaan (2012).[216] For Always Kabhi Kabhi (2011), which was produced by Red Chillies, Khan participated in the lyrical composition.[217]\\nIn addition to his early television serial appearances, Khan has hosted numerous televised awards shows, including the Filmfare, Zee Cine, and Screen Awards.[218][219][220] In 2007, he replaced Amitabh Bachchan for one season as the host of Kaun Banega Crorepati, the Indian version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?,[221] and a year later, Khan began hosting Kya Aap Paanchvi Pass Se Tez Hain?, the Indian version of Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?.[222] In 2011, he returned to television, appearing on Imagine TV\\'s Zor Ka Jhatka: Total Wipeout, the Indian version of Wipeout; scenes featuring Khan were shot at the Yash Raj Studios in Mumbai.[223] Contrary to his earlier television anchoring jobs, Zor Ka Jhatka: Total Wipeout performed poorly. It aired for only one season and became the lowest rated show hosted by a Bollywood star.[223] In 2017, Khan began hosting TED Talks India Nayi Soch, a talk show produced by TED Conferences, LLC which started aired on STAR Plus.[224]\\nStage performances\\nKhan is a frequent stage performer and has participated in several world tours and concerts. In 1997, he performed in Asha Bhosle\\'s Moments in Time concert in Malaysia, and returned the following year to perform with Karisma Kapoor for the Shahrukh–Karisma: Live in Malaysia concert.[225] The same year, he participated in The Awesome Foursome world tour across the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States along with Juhi Chawla, Akshay Kumar and Kajol, and resumed the tour in Malaysia the following year.[226][227] In 2002, Khan featured with Amitabh Bachchan, Aamir Khan, Preity Zinta, and Aishwarya Rai in the show From India With Love at Manchester\\'s Old Trafford and London\\'s Hyde Park; the event was attended by more than 100,000\\xa0people.[228] Khan performed alongside Rani Mukherji, Arjun Rampal and Ishaa Koppikar in a 2010 concert at the St. Joseph High School field in Dhaka, Bangladesh.[229] The next year he joined Shahid Kapoor and Priyanka Chopra in the Friendship Concert, celebrating 150\\xa0years of India–South Africa friendship in Durban, South Africa.[230]\\nKhan started an association with the \"Temptations\" series of concert tours by singing, dancing, and performing skits alongside Arjun Rampal, Priyanka Chopra, and other Bollywood stars in Temptations 2004, a stage show that toured 22\\xa0venues across the world.[231] The show played to 15,000\\xa0spectators at Dubai\\'s Festival City Arena.[232] In 2008, Khan set up Temptation Reloaded, a series of concerts that toured several countries, including the Netherlands.[233] Another tour was held with Bipasha Basu and others in 2012 in Jakarta,[234] and in 2013 another series of concerts visited Auckland, Perth and Sydney.[235] In 2014, Khan performed in SLAM!
